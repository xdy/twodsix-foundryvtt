Damage is only deducted from END, considering any armor. If the target’s END is reduced to 0 from stun damage, the target is incapacitated and unable to perform any actions for a number of rounds by which the damage exceeded his END. Damage received from stun weapons is completely healed after one hour of rest.</div>",
