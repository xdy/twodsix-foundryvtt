    "description": "A stubby, tube-like weapon using a graviic launch system to deliver a capsule to its target. On a hit, the capsule erupts into a mass of adhesive tentacle-like strands, entangling the target creature and any other creature within a 5m radius. Any creature caught in the strands must roll STR 12+ to break out. The Tangler Gun creates enough strands to entangle a creature up to 500kg in weight; larger creatures are unaffected. On a failed roll, the target is immobilized and cannot act; they may attempt to free themselves each minute (10 combat rounds). Other characters can also cut entangled targets free using edged weapons. The Tangler comes with solvent capsules – which the weapon itself can launch as projectiles – which dissolve the tangling strands holding captives. Tangler strands hit with a solvent capsule will dissolve in one minute.",
