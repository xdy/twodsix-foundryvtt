    "description": "Plasma Gun (TL12): High-energy anti-vehicular man-portable weapon firing magnetically-contained plasma bolts. It requires a back-mounted, rechargeable power pack counting as two Items for encumbrance purposes (included in weapon weight).<br><br>Bulky: A Bulky weapon has powerful recoil or is simply extremely heavy. This makes it difficult to use effectively in combat by someone of a weak physical stature. Characters with STR 8 or less suffer DM-2 when using such weapons. Bipod and Tripod accessories (see below) remove the Bulky aspect, as long as the weapon is stationary and mounted on the bipod or tripod.<br><br>Fire: On a successful hit, throw 6+ for the target to catch fire. A burning target takes 2D damage per combat round for 1D rounds, or until put out. See the Environmental Hazard Chapter for Fire effects.",
