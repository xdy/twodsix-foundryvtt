    "description": "The Hooligan Tool is a 0.8-meter, 4 kg tool is designed to breach common door/hatch types. There is forked spade end (for getting doors open), a horn (for getting that initial grab into opening an iris valve or busting padlocks), and a wedge (for those pesky hatches). The tool is designed to maximize leverage. Made of special alloys and composites, the tool is non- sparking, a feature that prevents accidents in explosive atmospheres such as a ship with a liquid hydrogen leak. Complete with fiberglass shaft and hand grips made from non-conducting material.",
