    "description": "Man-portable rocket launcher utilizing unguided munitions. Rocket launchers are unsafe to use in enclosed spaces. Rocket payloads are considered high explosive and are not particularly effective against armored vehicles. Armor piercing rockets cost Cr500 per rocket: trade Blast 6 for 2 AV hits, Blast 1. An anti-aircraft homing missile (2 AV hits) costs Cr10000 and does not suffer a penalty when firing at fast-moving air vehicles.<br><br>Blast 6: This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise effective against all targets in its blast radius. The number given is the blast radius in meters. It is possible to avoid or minimize blast damage, see Diving for Cover in the Combat chapter.<br><br>Bulky: A Bulky weapon has powerful recoil or is simply extremely heavy. This makes it difficult to use effectively in combat by someone of a weak physical stature. Characters with STR 8 or less suffer DM-2 when using such weapons. Bipod and Tripod accessories (see below) remove the Bulky aspect, as long as the weapon is stationary and mounted on the bipod or tripod.",
