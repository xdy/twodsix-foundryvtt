Throw Stealth/DEX 8+ to hide from searchlights. Throw Stealth/END 8+ if the character has to hide and stay motionless for long periods. Bypassing more advanced sensors and security systems require specialized equipment and impose higher Target Numbers. Characters without Stealth or Recon roll to spot interlopers unskilled.",
