    "description": "An Exoskeleton grants its user a +6 bonus to their STR score for Athletics/STR skill checks. It also allows the character to jump up to 2m vertically, or 5m horizontally, and increases the wearer’s movement speed to 15m/action. Another benefit is that the exoskeleton allows soldiers to march their normal cross-country speed while tiring at half the rate. The exokeleton’s batteries are good for 48 hours of activity before requiring replacement. At higher tech levels, exoskeletons are often replaced by cybernetics.",
