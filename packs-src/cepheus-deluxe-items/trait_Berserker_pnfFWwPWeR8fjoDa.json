    "description": "When injured in combat, the character can fly into a blind rage. Assuming the character is conscious, the character may elect to unleash their rage. This grants DM+1 to hit and to damage in melee combat, but also grants the character's enemies DM+1 to hit them. The effect lasts effect until the end of that particular combat encounter and the character may repeat it in any additional combat encounters in which they suffer new damage.",
