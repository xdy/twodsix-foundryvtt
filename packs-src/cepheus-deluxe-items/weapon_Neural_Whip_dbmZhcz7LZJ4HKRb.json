    "description": "Consists of a stocky handle connected to a flexible strap. Each stroke by this weapon causes stun damage as above. However, it has two additional vicious effects. First, any target hit by a neural whip must throw END 10+ or fall to the ground suffering from nightmarish pain and be incapacitated for 2D6 combat rounds. Second, in addition to the stun damage, the neural whip causes 1D physical damage per hit.<br><br>Stun: These weapons deal non-lethal damage and will incapacitate a living target instead of killing it. Damage is only deducted from Stamina, after considering any armor. If the target’s Stamina is reduced to 0, the target is incapacitated and unable to perform any actions for a number of rounds by which the damage exceeded his Stamina. Characters completely recover from Stun damage after one hour of rest.",
