Considered as two items for encumbrance purposes.<br><br>Auto 4: These weapons fire multiple rounds with every pull of the trigger, filling the air with a hail of fire. A weapon with the Auto aspect can make attacks in three fire modes: single, burst, and full auto, as described in the Combat chapter.<br><br>Bulky: A Bulky weapon has powerful recoil or is simply extremely heavy. This makes it difficult to use effectively in combat by someone of a weak physical stature. Characters with STR 8 or less suffer DM-2 when using such weapons. Bipod and Tripod accessories (see below) remove the Bulky aspect, as long as the weapon is stationary and mounted on the bipod or tripod.",
