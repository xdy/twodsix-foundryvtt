The Navigator on a starship plots the course and ensures that the astrogational information required by the pilot and other crewmembers is available when it is needed. This skill includes the ability to determine a ship's new location after a Jump ends, plotting a standard course through normal space, and plotting a Jump route through Jump space. A starship cannot make a Jump safely without a Jump route.",
