Because its uses tend to be</div><div>rather broad, this is a skill that many times do not get a penalty to roll</div><div>for simple tasks unskilled (see p. 14).</div><div>At the Referee’s discretion, you may add the Athletics skill to</div><div>appropriate physical characteristic rolls (for dangerous jumps or</div><div>dodges, for example).</div><div>• Climb a high tree quickly: roll Athletics (DEX or STR) 6+. If the tree has low</div><div>branches to get an initial boost, don’t apply a penalty if the character doesn’t</div><div>have a level in Athletics.</div><div>• Climb a steep cliff: roll Athletics (DEX or STR) 8+, or 6+ with basic climbing</div><div>equipment.</div><div>• Swim in a stormy ocean: roll Athletics (STR) 8+. Failure might mean the</div><div>character starts sinking, specially if they’re trying to bring along substantial</div><div>gear on their back.</div>",
