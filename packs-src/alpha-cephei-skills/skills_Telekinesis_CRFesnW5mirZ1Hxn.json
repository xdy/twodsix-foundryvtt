Can cause 1D damage if hurled at a target.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Lift 100kg (PSI 5, 50m): lift and maneuver up to a 100kg object for 1D combat rounds. This will cause 3D damage if hurled at a target.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Telekinetic Shield (PSI 3 but see cost below, personal): this creates an invisible barrier against fast moving attacks in front of the psion’s hand, covering a 1,5m x 1,5m area. This gives the user 2 points of armor protection for each PSI point spent on activation against attacks from that direction. After activated, it lasts until the beginning of the psion’s next round.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Choke (PSI 8, 10m): grab a single human-sized creature by its throat, or equivalent, and suffocate them for 1D damage per round, for a maximum number of rounds equal to the character's full PSI score.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Microkinesis (PSI 10 but see cost below, personal): manipulate microscopic objects. Microkinesis may be used for subtle, but highly effective attacks on internal organs, causing 1D damage per 2 PSI points spent. Alternatively, this power may aid microsurgery by +1 per 3 PSI points spent. Finally, the psion may assist Engineering and Repair skill checks by +1 per 3 PSI points spent.</div>",
