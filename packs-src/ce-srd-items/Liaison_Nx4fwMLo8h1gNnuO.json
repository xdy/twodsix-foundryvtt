    "description": "The character is trained in the art of dealing with others, including knowledge of proper protocols, manners of address, codes of conduct and other information needed when dealing with a wide range of societal types. Such a character is quite useful when attempting to negotiate a particularly edgy deal, to convince the Duke's secretary to admit the party into the Duke's presence, help settle a dispute between two opposing groups, or other acts of negotiation and diplomacy.   Influencing Others: The character can change others' attitudes with a successful check. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Liaison checks to see who gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve cases when two diplomats are engaged in negotiations.",
