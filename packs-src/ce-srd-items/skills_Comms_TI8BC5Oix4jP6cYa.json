    "description": "The character is trained in the use, repair, and maintenance of communications and sensor devices. While anyone can press the button and make a communicator function, this skill is necessary to understand why the device does not work, or how to use the device for purposes other than open transmission. When using sensors, this skill allows the character to interpret the long-range data of a ship's sensors and scanners. Skilled characters can boost an incoming or outgoing signal, create or break a secure channel, detect signals and anomalies, hide or piggyback on another signal, jam local communications, locate and assess potential threats, and analyze complex sensor data.",
