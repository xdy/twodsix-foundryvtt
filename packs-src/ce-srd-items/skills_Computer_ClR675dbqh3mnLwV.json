    "description": "The character is skilled in the programming and operation of electronic and fiber optic computers, both ground and shipboard models. Computers can be found on any world with a TL of 8 or higher, becoming exponentially more common at higher technology levels. A character without at least some computer training might find himself at disadvantage in the highly technical universe of science fiction. Anyone with Computer-0 or better can perform the following without a skill check: Log on to a Datanet, send and receive messages, search for non-classified information, and retrieve data and files. More skilled users can create or break data encryption, mine data effectively, create or break data and network security protocols, and perform other general programming tasks.",
