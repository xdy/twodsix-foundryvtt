    "description": "The character possesses the ability to rally, inspire, organize and direct team efforts to ensure the best cooperation and productivity possible.   Coordinating Effort: Whenever a task requires one or more characters to combine their efforts (i.e. Teamwork, each makes a skill or ability check towards a common goal), the character gains a pool of points equal to the Effect of the skill check (minimum of 1), which can be distributed by the leader to individual team members as DMs (grant a +1 DM per point) on skill or ability checks made toward the common goal.   Improving Initiative: The Leadership skill can be used to increase another character's Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a Leadership check, and the target character's Initiative is increased by the Effect of the check. Making a Leadership skill check is a significant action.",
