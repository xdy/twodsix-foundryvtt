A [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) system for running games using various 2d6-based role-playing games, specifically those based on the Cepheus Engine.

Install by either searching for Twodsix in in [FoundryVTT's](https://foundryvtt.com/) Game Systems tab and clicking Install or by clicking the 'Install System' button in that tab and entering the following as the Manifest URL: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/releases/latest/download/system.json

In play - using a number of Foundry modules - it can look something like this:

![Twodsix in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/master/static/assets/twodsix_screenshot.webp)

It is compatible with the core rules of Cepheus Engine, but the intention is to make it flexible enough to play other 2d6 rules variants.

System settings and compendiums are available that make it compatible with Cepheus Light, Cepheus Faster Than Light, Cepheus Atom, Cepheus Quantum and to some extent Barbaric!. (See [docs.md](docs/docs.md) for more information on how to set up Twodsix.)

Due to licensing restrictions the user will themselves have to fill compendiums for other variants with skills, items, etc.

This system may eventually claim compatibility with other specific rules sets once it:

* actually has the license to do so

It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion
It is by the beans of Java that thoughts acquire speed
The hands acquire shakes
The shakes become a warning
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion
