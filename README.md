# 2d6 system

A system for running games using the world's oldest science fiction rpg system and it's various derivatives.

Or. Actually. It's currently an utterly non-functional system with a nice build system. ;)

When I decided to try to add a new system to foundry, did I:
a) simply use the sws until I know what I want?
OR
b) just make a character sheet?
OR
c) set up a basic system that I can expand later?
OR
d) set up tooling, automated releases using semantic versioning, dotting every i and crossing every t to make github happy, etc, for the fvtt system I might eventually build if I ever get around to actually working on it?

Um. D. Of course. Like any sane person would...

Oh, and for the record. The tooling and automated releases work fine. The system? Not so much. :slight_smile:
