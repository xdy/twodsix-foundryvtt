A [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) system for running games using various 2d6-based role-playing games, specifically those based on the Cepheus Engine.

Install by either searching for Twodsix in in [FoundryVTT's](https://foundryvtt.com/) Game Systems tab and clicking Install or by clicking the 'Install System' button in that tab and entering the following as the Manifest URL: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/releases/latest/download/system.json

**TAKE A BACKUP** before you switch from any 1.x or 2.x version of Twodsix to a Twodsix 3.x or 4.x version, as that requires Foundry v11. The conversion to v11 is **one-way**. The only way to go back is to restore a backup.

In play - using a number of Foundry modules - it can look something like this:

<img width="1368" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 12 18 03 PM" src="https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/02292d5c-51fa-4810-9921-dc73fcec8770">

It is compatible with the core rules of Cepheus Engine, but the intention is to make it flexible enough to play other 2d6 rules variants.

System settings and compendiums are available that make it compatible with Cepheus Light, Cepheus Faster Than Light, Cepheus Atom, Cepheus Quantum and to some extent Barbaric!. (See [the wiki](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/System-Configuration-Guide) for more information on how to set up Twodsix.)

Due to licensing restrictions the user will themselves have to fill compendiums for other variants with skills, items, etc.

This system may eventually claim compatibility with other specific rules sets once it:
* actually has said compatibility 
* actually has the license to do so
