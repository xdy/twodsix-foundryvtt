It mainly supports Cepheus Engine, but the intention is to make it flexible enough to play all/most 2d6 rules variants using this system.
Due to licensing restrictions the user will have to fill compendiums with skills, etc, themselves. (When completed, data from Cepheus Engine will be included.)

a) actually has said compatibility
