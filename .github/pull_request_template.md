* **Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**
- [ ] We use semantic versioning (https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release to be specific), so follow https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines *EXCEPT*, don't use 'feat:' if you're not me. Stepping major versions until 1.0 is a deliberate decision (after that, it'll be full semantic versioning.) 
- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)
