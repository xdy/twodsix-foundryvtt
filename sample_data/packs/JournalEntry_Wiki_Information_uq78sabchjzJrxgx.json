        "content": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Enhancers are special elements on a Journal Page that allow for interactivity. For example, adding the text (while editing) [[/r 2d6]] will create a button that makes a roll with two, six-sided dice. Core foundry has many other enhanced features for Journal entries - such as dragging and dropping a link to other objects, actors and tables. See this page ( https://foundryvtt.com/article/journal/ ) under \"Dynamic Document Links.\"</p><h1>Custom Enhancers for Twodsix</h1><p>Twodsix currently has three custom enhancers that extend the core FVTT capability. These enhancers are @DisplayTable,@SkillRoll, and @ItemList.</p><h2>@DisplayTable</h2><p>Normal dragging and dropping of a Roll Table onto a Journal Entry page creates a link that opens that table. The @DisplayTable option will instead display the table in a html formatted table. For example, displaying one of the compendium macro tables will look like this,</p><img width=\"601\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 8 42 47 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/d5ba0742-0c20-42cc-8007-4f6d42866f73\" /><p>The format for the enhancer is <code>@DisplayTable[UUID or Table Name]{Text Label}</code>. The easiest way to create this display is to drag and drop the table. You should see a UUID link something like <code>@UUID[RollTable.u8586ms09wZNqpwN]{Population}</code>. Change the @UUID prefix to @DisplayTable: <code>@DisplayTable[RollTable.u8586ms09wZNqpwN]{Population}</code>. Subtables are displayed as the default <code>@UUID[Rolltable.uuid]{optional description}</code> link.</p><h2>@Table</h2><p>This enricher creates a button to directly roll a table result without displaying the table. It has the format <code>@Table[Rolltable.uuid]{optional description}</code>. As per @DisplayTable, the easiest way to create is to drag-drop the table into the editor and replace @UUID with @Table.</p><h2>@SkillRoll</h2><p>The @SkillRoll feature creates a clickable skill roll similar to the way skill rolls work for ship positions (https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/How-to-use-the-ship-sheet#positions-tab) except that there are no components to link. The general format is <code>@SkillRoll[skill name | alt skill name / CHR #+]{Custom Text}</code>. For example, this string <code>@SkillRoll[Zero-G/DEX 10+]{Zero-G Test}</code> creates a button label 'Zero-G Test' and rolls a skill check for the Zero-G skill using dexterity characteristic and a difficulty threshold of 10+ (very difficult or difficult - depending on rules). Note that the characteristic and difficulty terms are optional. The skill's default values for characteristic modifier and difficulty are used when nothing is specified in the formula.</p><p>If <code>None</code> is entered for the skill, the click will make a characteristic roll. The CHR string should be the abbreviation shown on the actor sheet. So if the characteristic label has been customized, use that custom label in the formula.</p><p>For difficulty values that are odd, e.g. 5+, the code chooses the next highest difficulty and adds a custom +1 DM. A player's default character is used for the skill roll actor/context data. As a GM, the <em>selected</em> character is used for the roll.</p><h2>@ItemList</h2><p>The @ItemList feature creates a drag / droppable list of items that can be added to an actor. This is a connivence to quickly drop a collection of items (of mixed types) - for example a character package with initial skills and items. The general format is <code>@ItemList itemRef1, itemRef2, ...</code>, where 'itemRef' can be an item name or UUID. For example, <code>@ItemList Auto Pistol , Cloth, Item.8l6XwFOpHSDCO8tV,Item.pZ8gc26I9shWaAax, Compendium.twodsix.cepheus-deluxe-items.Item.bwjiHCfwS9naDUVy</code>. UUID's can be easily accessed from an item sheet by clicking on the passport icon in the header. This copies the fill UUID to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into the JournalEntry. Invalid UUID links will be displayed with the broken link symbol.</p>",

This tutorial will be written from the perspective of someone using forge vtt.</p>\n<p>After the administrative side of things is complete (creating your account, server) the first step will be to launch your world. </p>\n<p>Next you need to download/install the game system. Click on the Game Systems tab and search for \"twodsix.\" Click install. Note, the system does not update automatically, so it will require you to manually click check for update and then update. </p>\n<p>Now that the core game system is installed, click on create your world (image). Here you will have to give a name to the world, a name to the data path and select a system. In this case, the system is twodsix. Click create world (image). Now the world can be launched, so click launch world. </p>\n<p>You will be presented with the world setup screen. To enter the world, a role needs to be selected, so select gamemaster and click join game session. </p>\n<p>The actual VTT will now be presented. The place any referee should go is to game settings, which is the final tab (image). In this case the referee must go there, as compendiums (an essential aspect of the VTT) will not be enabled otherwise. Note: compendiums are already enabled, so x out the banner. </p>\n<p>Click on configure settings.  Here are the game variations that can be chosen, subjects such as auto rolling for damage, initiative order, automatic weapons and so on. You can also choose the game rules that will be used. Default is cepheus engine. </p>\n<p>Next of note are the compendiums (the second to last tab). These compendiums are not exhaustive and for Mongoose Traveller content, this will need to create this yourself. </p>\n<p>To create a character, go to the fourth tab. Click on create actor. It will need a name and a type. In our case, the name is Rufus and the type is traveller. </p>\n<p>The character sheet is largely as would be experienced on the table top, with inventory, skills, and characteristics. As well, what you see is what you get, so if there is an alternative SOC characteristic, for example, you will need to just pretend SOC says something else. Characteristics will automatically apply modifiers, so if you put in a 15 for STR your modifier will be a +3. The red 0 under the characteristic is for temporary stat loss. Apply the number lost here and the charactersheet will update automatically. If Rufus were to take 14 points of damage to strength his modifier will now become a -2. </p>\n<p>To give skills to Rufus, open the skills compendium of choice (in this case, 2e skills) and drag and drop. </p>\n<p>You will note the prodigious strength of Rufus does not apply to Athletics: Strength in the above screenshot. Click on the pen and paper to edit. Now defaults can be set, to give Rufus ranks in this skill and to set strength as the default characteristic. In this case, the default is STR and Rufus has 5 ranks. Note: Any changes here will be the default, so to make the check formidable and with disadvantage for Rufus, it is better to do so when rolling the skill.</p>\n<p>To roll the skill, click on the name. A box will appear and here is where the difficulty of the task can be changed, advantage/disadvantage applied, temporary modifiers and the visibility of the roll. (all of these will get their own wiki page). In our case, Rufus is rolling a formidable check with disadvantage. To see the result, go to the dialogue tab. To see what he actually rolled, click on the formula or number. In this instance for Rufus you will see that he rolled 4, 6 and 2 and lost the 6 due to disadvantage. You will also see that this is a roll without effect; to enable effect navigate to system settings and selec \"show effect or total roll value\"--now with a re-roll effect is calculated in the end roll.</p>",

This tutorial will be written from the perspective of someone using forge vtt.\n\nAfter the administrative side of things is complete (creating your account, server) the first step will be to launch your world. \n\nNext you need to download/install the game system. Click on the Game Systems tab and search for \"twodsix.\" Click install. Note, the system does not update automatically, so it will require you to manually click check for update and then update. \n\nNow that the core game system is installed, click on create your world (image). Here you will have to give a name to the world, a name to the data path and select a system. In this case, the system is twodsix. Click create world (image). Now the world can be launched, so click launch world. \n\nYou will be presented with the world setup screen. To enter the world, a role needs to be selected, so select gamemaster and click join game session. \n\nThe actual VTT will now be presented. The place any referee should go is to game settings, which is the final tab (image). In this case the referee must go there, as compendiums (an essential aspect of the VTT) will not be enabled otherwise. Note: compendiums are already enabled, so x out the banner. \n\nClick on configure settings.  Here are the game variations that can be chosen, subjects such as auto rolling for damage, initiative order, automatic weapons and so on. You can also choose the game rules that will be used. Default is cepheus engine. \n\nNext of note are the compendiums (the second to last tab). These compendiums are not exhaustive and for Mongoose Traveller content, this will need to create this yourself. \n\nTo create a character, go to the fourth tab. Click on create actor. It will need a name and a type. In our case, the name is Rufus and the type is traveller. \n\nThe character sheet is largely as would be experienced on the table top, with inventory, skills, and characteristics. As well, what you see is what you get, so if there is an alternative SOC characteristic, for example, you will need to just pretend SOC says something else. Characteristics will automatically apply modifiers, so if you put in a 15 for STR your modifier will be a +3. The red 0 under the characteristic is for temporary stat loss. Apply the number lost here and the charactersheet will update automatically. If Rufus were to take 14 points of damage to strength his modifier will now become a -2. \n\nTo give skills to Rufus, open the skills compendium of choice (in this case, 2e skills) and drag and drop. \n\nYou will note the prodigious strength of Rufus does not apply to Athletics: Strength in the above screenshot. Click on the pen and paper to edit. Now defaults can be set, to give Rufus ranks in this skill and to set strength as the default characteristic. In this case, the default is STR and Rufus has 5 ranks. Note: Any changes here will be the default, so to make the check formidable and with disadvantage for Rufus, it is better to do so when rolling the skill.\n\nTo roll the skill, click on the name. A box will appear and here is where the difficulty of the task can be changed, advantage/disadvantage applied, temporary modifiers and the visibility of the roll. (all of these will get their own wiki page). In our case, Rufus is rolling a formidable check with disadvantage. To see the result, go to the dialogue tab. To see what he actually rolled, click on the formula or number. In this instance for Rufus you will see that he rolled 4, 6 and 2 and lost the 6 due to disadvantage. You will also see that this is a roll without effect; to enable effect navigate to system settings and selec \"show effect or total roll value\"--now with a re-roll effect is calculated in the end roll."

All characteristics have at least two values, a base value (the value when the actor is 100% healthy) and a damage value (shown in a red font, is the amount of damage that characteristic has sustained).  The image below shows the standard stats block.  STR (strength) has a base value of 6 with 1 point of damage - so the current strength is 5.

The <strong>Positions</strong> tab does enable some automation as described below</p>\n<h2>Positions Tab</h2>\n<p>Clicking on the Positions tab will show a box allowing the creation of a bespoke position/station for the ship’s crew</p>\n<p>Click on the +  sign (Add Ship Position) and a new new position will be created</p>\n<p>Clicking on the spanner icon will open a new window:</p>\n<p><strong>Position Name:</strong> As it says on the tin, type in chosen name for the position eg Sensor Op, Captain, etc Order: A simple numeric value to show the order of the positions shown on the ship sheet, ie. 1 will be top left , 2 will be top center, 3 top right </p>\n<p><strong>Travellers:</strong> This section is where crew members can be assigned. Travellers and robots are valid actor types.  If you are the GM or a player with permission to create new tokens, you can drag and drop the Character from the sidebar tab. Players without this permission may attach an actor by selecting the plus button.  A pop-up opens for the play to select <em>one</em> of their owned actors to attach to the position.</p>\n<p><strong>Actions:</strong> click on the + and it will add a new action. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Order</strong> is a numeric value again showing position</li>\n<li><strong>Name</strong>  (New Action by default) name the action e.g. Electronic Warfare, Command and Control, Fire Beam Laser</li>\n<li><strong>Macro/Skill</strong> This is what is given to the action type<ul>\n<li>For \"Chat\" it is simply what should be outputted in the chat when executing the action.  You can also specify a roll formula by starting the chat string with '/r' or '/R'. The action will make a chat roll as the normal chat box when the roll formula is valid. Note that two contexts (for roll data) are available. The <code>@</code> prefix will generally access any selected actor roll data (e.g. <code>@skills.Tactics</code>).  To access the ship roll data, prefix the element using <code>@ship</code>, (e.g. <code>@ship.combatPosition</code>).</li>\n<li>For \"Skill Roll\" The skill name has to be provided. Optionally one can also override the default characteristic for that skill or override the difficulty. The skill name will need to be as typed on the character sheet with the same capital, space etc  e.g. <code>Electronics (Sensors)</code>. If you want to override the characteristic add <code>/CHR</code> after the skill name, for example <code>Electronics (Sensors)/INT</code>. To override the difficulty you add it by typing a space and a number followed by a plus, e.g. <code>Electronics (Sensors) 10+</code>. You can both override the characteristic and difficulty at the same time as well (<code>Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+</code>).  Multiple skills and multiple characteristics can be configured by separating them with the pipe \"|\" character.  The most advantageous skill and/or characteristic for the Actor will be used by the action.  A hull repair action might be configured as <code>Engineering|Mechanic/INT|EDU 6+</code>.</li>\n<li>For \"Fire Energy Weapons\" you put in a skill (as described above) and select a component to use in the \"Component to use\" dropdown to the right. Currently, this feature is quite limited and will make a skill roll and output as a chat message that you hit with the component that was given. The format is the same as a skill roll, e.g. <code>Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+</code> (the characteristic and difficulty is optional). Note that the old style of specifying a component (by appending an \"=COMPONENT_ID\") still works.</li>\n<li>For \"Execute Macro\", you enter the name of the macro you want to execute.  The following documents are passed as context to the macro to make creating the macro easier.  <code>actor</code> is the selected actor document for the position.  <code>ship</code> is the ship document. <code>component</code> is the selected component.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Component to use</strong> drop down list of the non-cargo components to use for Fire Energy Weapons or Skill Roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Action Type</strong> drop down list for the action types described above (Chat, Skill Roll, Fire Energy Weapon, or Execute Macro).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This process will need to be done for each position.

To make such calculations work correctly, one needs to understand some important concepts. Key to all these calculations is the hull displacement value (ship size).  Several calculations need this value to work correctly, so it is important to enter a displacement value in the upper right corner of the main sheet.</p>\n<h3>Component Weight</h3>\n<p>Weight is assumed to be per unit.  So the calculation of the total power used by a component is the quantity * unit weight.  For armament and fuel, the calculation uses available quantity and not total quantity. However, unit weight may also be expressed as a percentage of the ship displacement weight (e.g. armor).  To calculate using percentage, enter the percentage form (e.g. 10 for 10%) and check the box \"Weight is Percentage?\".  For example, this calculation method is the typical method for components such as drives.  For systems such as Cepheus Deluxe, the percentage value to enter can be a bit tricky as there is both a base percentage and a scaling factor due to TL.  For example, a TL 11, m-drive rated at 2G has a base weight of 1.5% of the hull displacement and an associated scaling factor of 1.1.  The % displacement weight value to enter on the component sheet is 1.65 (1.5*1.1).</p>\n<p>For hull components, there is a special designation possible: \"Is Baseline Hull?\" (a checkbox).  If this box checked, the calculations assume that the component designates the displacement of the hull and the weight is not included as part of the carrying capacity (as it defines the maximum carrying capacity).  If autocalc is enabled and there is no valid displacement value entered, the sheet will fill in a displacement value based on a hull component that is the baseline hull.</p>\n<h3>Component Power</h3>\n<p>A component may either consume power or generate it.  The default is that a component consumes power unless it is a power component (then it assumes it generates power).  The \"Generates Power?\" checkbox may be changed to override these defaults.  For the single-line components listing, power generating components are listed with a \"+\" before their power values.</p>\n<h3>Component Price</h3>\n<p>There are four different ways to calculate a component price:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"MCr per unit\": This method prices a component as the price value entered times the total quantity.</li>\n<li>\"MCr per component ton\": This method prices a component as the price value entered times the component's weight. Note that this weight may be dependent on the hull displacement, so it is important to enter a valid displacement value.</li>\n<li>\"MCr per hull ton\": This method prices a component as the price value entered times the hull's displacement weight.  Again, a valid displacement value is necessary.</li>\n<li>\"MCr per 100 hull ton\": Similar to the above method, for each 100 tons and not each ton (generally good for small values).</li>\n<li>\"Percent of base hull value\":  This method prices a component as percentage of the base hull value (the hull component designated as \"Is Baseline Hull\"). This is typical for components such as armor. It is independent of quantity.</li>\n<li>\"Percent of base hull value per unit\": This method prices a component similar to the above method, but now quantity plays into the calculation.  For example, with a component quantity of 3 and percentage of 5, the net percentage calculated is 15.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the base hull (i.e. Is Baseline Hull), be certain to include any factors that affect the baseline cost as part of the hull.  For example, a streamlined hull cost 10 percent more.  Enter a value of \"0.11\" MCr/ton if hulls cost 0.1 MCr per ton, generally.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that Vehicle component costs are <em>not</em> included in ship price - per community recommendation.</p>\n<h2>Optional Battle Sheet</h2>\n<p>For Twodsix v5.8+, the system now includes a secondary sheet for ships called the \"Battle Sheet\".  It is meant to be a non-tabbed display of critical ship information that is relevant to ship combat.  This sheet could also be used as an alternative display for NPC ships.  Note that the data does not change for the ship actor - just the format of display.  One can go back and forth between the sheet display styles without issue.  One important difference is that the Battle Sheet does not display auto calculated values. The values for power, jump, thrust, and displacement can be changed irrespective on the auto calculate setting.  If you return to the normal ship view, these values should auto calculate correctly.

        "markdown": "## Creating and using the Ship sheet\nIn the ‘Actors directory’ of the FoundryVTT UI click on the Create Actor tab. This will open up a new window with options of Name: Type: and Folder: \n\nName and Folder are user options and can be as you wish. The Type option gives a drop down of either Character or Ship; you need to choose ship. This will create a new actor in your selected folder.\n\nLeft clicking on the name of the new ship will open up the ship sheet\n\nTop left hand corner of the sheet show the ship’s image. This can be changed by clicking on the image or via various modules such as Art Galley, just as you would for an actor’s Character sheet.  The image is not usable with Tokenizer.\n\nTo the right of the image is the name as selected when the sheet was created. This can be edited from the sheet.\n\nAlso to the right of the image there are a number of data fields \n* Displacement - The hull size (displacement) defined during the build process.  It represents the maximum mass the ship can carry.\n* TL - the technical level for the ship\n* Jump - the jump drive rating for the ship (in parsecs / hexes)\n* Thrust - the thrust rating for the m-drive in G\n* Fuel - current and maximum fuel available.  Currently, this field is a manually updated.  The bar can be clicked to toggle the label between \"Refined\" and \"Unrefined\".\n* Overdrive - a checkbox to indicate ship is in overdrive\n* Ship Hull - current and max hull points designated during the build process, according to which rule set you have opted for\n* Armor - type of armor installed (description) and the current and max armor points\n* Power management or Power and Weight Management section that contains further data on ship components\n\n### Power management\n  * Power Used and Max generated (based on all installed and operating power components)\n  * Systems - all systems power usage other than dives, sensors and weapons components\n  * M-Drive - sum of power draw for all drive components with \"m-Drive\" or \"m drive\" in name\n  * J-Drive - sum of power draw for all drive components with \"j-Drive\" or \"j drive\" in name\n  * Sensors - all sensor components power usage\n  * Weapons - all weapons components power usage\n\n_Note that power is only included for those components that have an on or damaged status.  Also, power draw / generated is assumed to be per unit.  So the calculation of the total power used by a component is the quantity * power draw/generated_\n\n### Power and Weight Management\n  * Power Used and Max generated (based on all installed and operating components (consumed show as used and generated show as max)\n  * Systems - total weight for all systems that are not cargo, fuel, or vehicle components\n  * Cargo - the total weight for all cargo components\n  * Fuel - the total weight for all fuel components\n  * Vehicles - the total weight for all vehicle components\n  * Avail. (Available) - weight (mass) available to be carried by the ship.  It is equal to the displacement minus the total mass of components.\n\n\nBelow these you will find a tab bar showing:\n* Crew\n* Components\n* Locker\n* Cargo\n* Finances\n* Notes\n\n## Tabs\n**Positions:** This allows the creation of ship’s stations predominantly, but not limited to, use during ship to ship combat\n\n**Crew:** Shows the crew roster\n\n**Components:** The different component parts of the ship as described in the build process\n\n**Locker:** The ship locker and allow the cataloging of equipment stored in the Ship’s Locker \n\n**Cargo** The manifest of cargo components and notes for tracking cargo\n\n**Finance:** A basic text field to allow the tracking of funds.  At the top are the ship hull's basic costs: purchase value, 40-year mortgage value, and monthly maintenance costs.  If auto calc is enabled, these values are calculated based on the component data.  Otherwise the fields are manual entry.\n\n**Notes:** This is a simple text box to allow the GM or player to add reference notes about the given ship\n\nThe ship sheet is under review and development and many of these current sections or for tracking purposes only with manual input. The **Positions** tab does enable some automation as described below\n\n## Positions Tab\nClicking on the Positions tab will show a box allowing the creation of a bespoke position/station for the ship’s crew\n\nClick on the +  sign (Add Ship Position) and a new new position will be created\n\nClicking on the spanner icon will open a new window:\n\n**Position Name:** As it says on the tin, type in chosen name for the position eg Sensor Op, Captain, etc Order: A simple numeric value to show the order of the positions shown on the ship sheet, ie. 1 will be top left , 2 will be top center, 3 top right \n\n**Travellers:** This section is where crew members can be assigned. Travellers and robots are valid actor types.  If you are the GM or a player with permission to create new tokens, you can drag and drop the Character from the sidebar tab. Players without this permission may attach an actor by selecting the plus button.  A pop-up opens for the play to select _one_ of their owned actors to attach to the position.\n\n**Actions:** click on the + and it will add a new action. \n* **Order** is a numeric value again showing position\n* **Name**  (New Action by default) name the action e.g. Electronic Warfare, Command and Control, Fire Beam Laser\n* **Macro/Skill** This is what is given to the action type\n  * For \"Chat\" it is simply what should be outputted in the chat when executing the action.  You can also specify a roll formula by starting the chat string with '/r' or '/R'. The action will make a chat roll as the normal chat box when the roll formula is valid. Note that two contexts (for roll data) are available. The `@` prefix will generally access any selected actor roll data (e.g. `@skills.Tactics`).  To access the ship roll data, prefix the element using `@ship`, (e.g. `@ship.combatPosition`).\n  * For \"Skill Roll\" The skill name has to be provided. Optionally one can also override the default characteristic for that skill or override the difficulty. The skill name will need to be as typed on the character sheet with the same capital, space etc  e.g. `Electronics (Sensors)`. If you want to override the characteristic add `/CHR` after the skill name, for example `Electronics (Sensors)/INT`. To override the difficulty you add it by typing a space and a number followed by a plus, e.g. `Electronics (Sensors) 10+`. You can both override the characteristic and difficulty at the same time as well (`Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+`).  Multiple skills and multiple characteristics can be configured by separating them with the pipe \"|\" character.  The most advantageous skill and/or characteristic for the Actor will be used by the action.  A hull repair action might be configured as `Engineering|Mechanic/INT|EDU 6+`.\n  * For \"Fire Energy Weapons\" you put in a skill (as described above) and select a component to use in the \"Component to use\" dropdown to the right. Currently, this feature is quite limited and will make a skill roll and output as a chat message that you hit with the component that was given. The format is the same as a skill roll, e.g. `Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+` (the characteristic and difficulty is optional). Note that the old style of specifying a component (by appending an \"=COMPONENT_ID\") still works.\n  * For \"Execute Macro\", you enter the name of the macro you want to execute.  The following documents are passed as context to the macro to make creating the macro easier.  `actor` is the selected actor document for the position.  `ship` is the ship document. `component` is the selected component.\n* **Component to use** drop down list of the non-cargo components to use for Fire Energy Weapons or Skill Roll.\n* **Action Type** drop down list for the action types described above (Chat, Skill Roll, Fire Energy Weapon, or Execute Macro).\n\nThis process will need to be done for each position. Each position can have single or multiple action and is totally bespoke \n\nOnce positions are created the Character can be dragged to the new position. This will link all actions to the individual character and utilise their skills for the action. \n\nA position can have more than one Character but a Character can only be at one given position at a time. To remove the Character from the position either drag him/her to another position or to remove totally drag to a neutral area of the ship sheet (do not drag over to the screen/canvas as this will place the token there)\n\n## Component Data\nThe component data is used to auto calculate ship weight, power and cost information (if the option is enabled).

Both armor and weapons must be configured to take advantage of this secondary armor feature.</p>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<p>First, make certain that the damage type field is visible on weapon sheets with this Item Setting:</p>\n<p><img width=\"575\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 9 01 23 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/228562832-98327f03-ab22-4f9c-8319-e5493efaf129.png\" /></p>\n<p>Next, check that the list of damage types covers the rules you are using under Ruleset Settings\nThe values for this setting should be <em>comma separated</em>.</p>\n<p><img width=\"577\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 18 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230200190-3999af78-1ebc-4d97-8727-228be44dee7f.png\" /></p>\n<p>The default list is: \"Ballistic, Bludgeoning, Corrosive, EMP, Energy, Fire, Laser, Piercing, Poison, Plasma, Psionic, Rad, Slashing, Smoke, Stun\". The types can be multiple words, such as \"Death Ray\".  If you make this field a blank and then reload the world, it will reset to the default list.</p>\n<p>Then, select a damage type in the damage type field for the weapon, e.g.</p>\n<p><img width=\"528\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 20 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230201031-2976c903-d46a-4ac5-afa4-8ae01062136e.png\" /></p>\n<p>Only one damage type may be used for weapons. Optionally, you can select a damage type for the active consumable (the magazine).  If the consumable and weapon both have damage types, the consumable's damage type is used. Otherwise the weapon's damage type is used.  If both are left blank, the calculations ignore damage type.</p>\n<h2>Armor</h2>\n<p>Secondary protection value is only included when the damage type matches one of the protection types for the armor.  To set protection types for armor, use the multi-select field for the armor.  Note that an armor may have more than one type of secondary protection (use cmd/cntl to select more than one option).  For example below, the armor provides secondary protection for both fire and laser damage types.</p>\n<p><img width=\"520\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 26 25 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230202768-8aba6303-58a7-4cc6-8b00-b3c917b8a92d.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Applied Damage</h2>\n<p>When dropping / applying damage to an actor, the net damage applied will consider the secondary armor values.  If there is a match between the weapon's damage type and <em>one</em> of the secondary protection types, the secondary armor value is added to the effective armor.  In the below example, the weapon causes fire damage and the armor worn by the target has secondary protection of both fire and laser.  Thus, the secondary protection value (2 in the image) is added to the effective armor value further reducing the damage applied.

        "markdown": "# Using Secondary Armor\nTwodsix now has the ability to use damage types and have the secondary armor protection optionally applied based on that damage type.  Both armor and weapons must be configured to take advantage of this secondary armor feature.\n\n## Weapons\nFirst, make certain that the damage type field is visible on weapon sheets with this Item Setting:\n\n<img width=\"575\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 9 01 23 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/228562832-98327f03-ab22-4f9c-8319-e5493efaf129.png\">\n\nNext, check that the list of damage types covers the rules you are using under Ruleset Settings\nThe values for this setting should be _comma separated_.\n\n<img width=\"577\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 18 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230200190-3999af78-1ebc-4d97-8727-228be44dee7f.png\">\n\nThe default list is: \"Ballistic, Bludgeoning, Corrosive, EMP, Energy, Fire, Laser, Piercing, Poison, Plasma, Psionic, Rad, Slashing, Smoke, Stun\". The types can be multiple words, such as \"Death Ray\".  If you make this field a blank and then reload the world, it will reset to the default list.\n\nThen, select a damage type in the damage type field for the weapon, e.g.\n\n<img width=\"528\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 20 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230201031-2976c903-d46a-4ac5-afa4-8ae01062136e.png\">\n\nOnly one damage type may be used for weapons. Optionally, you can select a damage type for the active consumable (the magazine).  If the consumable and weapon both have damage types, the consumable's damage type is used. Otherwise the weapon's damage type is used.  If both are left blank, the calculations ignore damage type.\n\n## Armor\nSecondary protection value is only included when the damage type matches one of the protection types for the armor.  To set protection types for armor, use the multi-select field for the armor.  Note that an armor may have more than one type of secondary protection (use cmd/cntl to select more than one option).  For example below, the armor provides secondary protection for both fire and laser damage types.\n\n<img width=\"520\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 26 25 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230202768-8aba6303-58a7-4cc6-8b00-b3c917b8a92d.png\">\n\n\n## Applied Damage\nWhen dropping / applying damage to an actor, the net damage applied will consider the secondary armor values.  If there is a match between the weapon's damage type and _one_ of the secondary protection types, the secondary armor value is added to the effective armor.  In the below example, the weapon causes fire damage and the armor worn by the target has secondary protection of both fire and laser.  Thus, the secondary protection value (2 in the image) is added to the effective armor value further reducing the damage applied. In this case, the total armor value is greater than the damage, so the actor takes no damage from the attack.\n\n<img width=\"401\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 9 16 05 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/228567311-46220f35-5523-454c-b859-8824074c7d72.png\">\n\n# Display of Primary and Secondary Armor on Actor Sheets\n## Options for Traveller Sheet\nThere are multiple ways to display the primary and secondary armor values on the Traveller actor sheet.

Rather, DM are added based on the weapon used and the target's armor.  These modifiers, as defined in the <em>The Traveller Book</em> (pg. 46) have been automated in the calculations.  However, one must specify the weapon type (range band) and armor type for the target.

Please note this when entering item weights.</li>\n<li>There is no initiative in CT, per se, as all combat actions occur simultaneously. Nonetheless an initiative formula has been added to the default settings if one wants to home-brew combat order.</li>\n<li>Automatic fire follows the format of CT - e.g. single fire/auto.  So for most automatic weapons, that would be '1/4'.  A submachine gun would be '0/4' if you don't allow it to use single fire mode.  If the automatic rifle is used in single shot mode, DM's for a rifle are used instead (per RAW).  If the submachine gun is used in single fire mode, DM's for an auto pistol are used instead (home-brew). <em>The system does not implement the Group Hits by Automatic Fire or Shotguns</em>. GM's will need to implement those features by hand.</li>\n<li>Armor has a 'DM' listed after the armor name on the actor sheets.  This DM is <em>added</em> to the default weapon-armor modifier.  It is typical for animals that have modified armor type.  For example, using an automatic pistol against cloth armor with a DM of -2 would have a net weapon-armor DM of -5 (-3 base and -2 for the additional modifier).</li>\n<li>Jack-of-All-Trades (JOAT) works a bit differently for CT than other rulesets.  For the RAW, the value is binary.  Meaning that a JOAT of one (or more), the untrained skill value is zero.  If JOAT is zero, the untrained skill is -3 (the system default).  The RAW have that player characters have default zero-level skills for all weapon types (that need to be added to the character sheet).</li>\n<li>As of version 4.24.0, it is now possible to add custom range and armor modifiers to weapons.  See, https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Custom-CT-Modifiers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Right now, there is just an items compendium consisting of skills, weapons and armor for CT, although we may expand in the future.  All descriptions are from the Cepheus Item SRD and not <em>The Classic Traveller Book</em> (per use terms).  As a starting point, the CE compendium would be a good start to add other items.</p>\n<h2>Cepheus Universal</h2>\n<p>With version 5.9+ there is now basic support for Cepheus Universal (CU).  There is a rules setting that customizes the advanced settings so there should be no other changes needed.  A few things to note about the implementation and the compromises to fit it within the broader Twodsix setting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rate-of-fire / Auto X is used to specify an automatic weapon.  A single integer of 4, 10, or 20 is valid per rules.  The input is not constrained to these values and will default to single fire.</li>\n<li>Weapon recoil is handled using the \"weapons handling\" feature (<a href=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Weapons-Handling-Feature\">Weapons Handling</a>).  The CU compendium shows examples of how to configure this setting to work per the CU recoil rules.  Recoil for auto fire is adjusted per the rules.</li>\n<li>Armor protection works very differently with CU.  Armor protects against specific damage types.  So all armor and weapons must define the type of damage they block or cause.  Also, there is no primary or secondary armor values - just a single armor value.  For those wanting to make changes to the armor value using Active Effects, the field used is <code>system.secondaryArmor.value</code>.</li>\n<li>Rolling for parry of an attack is handled automatically.  However, certain conditions must be met.  The attack must cause melee damage. The system looks for the \"Melee Combat\" skill (or its localized equivalent) for the parry attempt.  For most weapons, the attack must be within personal or close range.  An item may parry longer ranged melee attacks (e.g. a bow and arrow) if the item has the \"Acts as shield\" characteristic checked (e.g. the weapon is a shield).\nExample of damage that can be parried (note arrow symbol)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img width=\"288\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 8 18 20 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c5a1d6-b491-4bbc-8fd8-8e502ff908a8\" /></p>\n<p>Example of damage that can be shielded (note shield symbol):</p>\n<p><img width=\"283\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 8 19 00 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8646b85-f821-4d26-a5c7-4d7dc998f61b\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Characteristic rolls are meant to be 6+ in difficulty.

        "markdown": "## Cepheus Engine\nComplete skill and personal equipment compendiums are available (supplied by @marvin9257).\nAll system settings default to Cepheus Engine rules, but you may want to turn on some automation in the system settings (see General Features below).\n\n## Cepheus Deluxe\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Deluxe select 'Cepheus Deluxe' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings.\n* Turn on \"Show 'Lifeblood' and 'Stamina' characteristics and use for damage.\"  This option displays lifeblood and stamina inputs at the bottom of the biography section of the actor sheet.  The battery icon is stamina and the heart-beat icon is lifeblood.  For each pair, the blue number is the maximum value and the red is the corresponding damage.  So, a blue value of 7 and a red value of 3 means that the current value is 4.  Note that this setting also overrides how damage is implemented - applying it to LFB and STA rather than the standard characteristics.\n\nSupport for Traits was added to the system with version 0.8.14\n\nBasic support for new Lifeblood and Stamina characteristics added in version 0.8.26.  Lifeblood and Stamina are supported along with wounded status (if enabled by option).\n\nCompendiums for Cepheus Deluxe excluding ship, vehicle, and robot information are included with the system.\n\n\n## Cepheus Light\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Light (which should also work fairly well for related systems like Sword of Cepheus if you don't mind the SF theming) select 'Cepheus Light' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Select the setting to handle difficulties by changing the target number rather than adding/subtracting modifiers.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Tactics skill yourself after rolling , or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros)\n* Select CEL style autofire rules\n* Sets a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Use the skills, items, etc from the various 'ce light-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers.\n\n## Cepheus Light Upgraded\nAs Cepheus Light above, but choose 'Cepheus Light Upgraded' instead.\n\n## Cepheus Faster Than Light\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Faster Than Light select 'Cepheus Faster Than Light' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Select the setting to handle difficulties by changing the target number rather than adding/subtracting modifiers.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Tactics skill yourself after rolling, or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros)\n* Sets a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Use the skills, items, etc from the various 'ce ftl-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers (this is already done in the above compendiums).\n\nReasonably complete compendiums for Cepheus Faster Than Light exist.\n\n## Cepheus Atom\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Atom select 'Cepheus Atom' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Combat skill yourself after rolling ,or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros - though you need to change line 5 of the macro to use the 'Combat' skill rather than the 'Tactics' skill).\n* Set a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n* Turn on \"Show END and 'Lifeblood' (STR) as characteristics\" (which also makes Contamination show)\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Use the skills, items, etc from the various 'cepheus atom-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers (this is already done in the above compendiums).\n* Give every character JOAT-3 on the skills tab.\n* Mutations exist in a compendum as items (augmentations). Any effects on the character will need to be handled manually.\n\nCompendiums containing skills, items, mutations, robots and monsters are included, additionally the various compendiums from Cepheus FTL might be useful.\nThere is also a gm screen compendium suitable for use with the https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gm-screen module.\n\n## Barbaric!\nTo get the system closer to Barbaric! select 'Barbaric!' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Combat skill yourself after rolling ,or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros - though you need to change line 5 of the macro to use the 'Combat' skill rather than the 'Tactics' skill).\n* Set a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n* Set \"What effect (if above 0) is required for a throw to be considered a critical success/failure (i.e. be colored green/red).\" to 4. (Actually only relevant for Spellcasting).\n* Turn on \"Show END and 'Lifeblood' (STR) as characteristics\" (which also makes Contamination show)\n* Turn off \"Show Contamination below Lifeblood\"\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers (this is already done in the above compendiums).\n* Give every character JOAT-3 on the skills tab.\n* Races and Traits can be handled like Mutations in Cepheus Atom.\n\nNo compendiums for Barbaric! yet exist, though the ones from Cepheus Atom are somewhat useful, as examples if nothing else.\n\n## Cepheus Quantum\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Quantum select 'Cepheus Quantum' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers.\n* Use the careers, items, etc from the 'cepheus quantum-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Change the initiative formula to just 1d1\n* Turn on \"Show END and 'Lifeblood' (STR) as characteristics\"\n* Turn off \"Show Contamination below Lifeblood\"\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Create a character by importing one of the careers from the career compendium and renaming it to your character's name, then changing the attributes.\n* Give every character JOAT-3 on the skills tab.\n* Ignore the initiative that gets rolled, everyone gets the same initiative (optionally, you might want to take a look at the https://foundryvtt.com/packages/Popcorn module if you want some structure to the initiative)\n\nReasonably complete compendiums for Cepheus Quantum exist, additionally the various compendiums from Cepheus FTL might be useful.\nThere is also a gm screen compendium suitable for use with the https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gm-screen module.\n\n## MGT1\nTo get the system closer to MGT1 switch to 'Cepheus Engine' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings.\n\nCompendiums with skills, items, etc cannot be included for licensing reasons, so you have to enter those yourself, but the various Cepheus Engine compendium are sufficiently close that they should be useful, even though they are not for MTG1. (Cepheus Engine is pretty much the Open Gaming License version of MTG1.)\n\n## MGT2\nTo get the system closer to MGT2 change the following in the system settings after switching to 'Other' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings:\n\n* Choose the CE difficulty list.\n* Change the initiative formula to \"2d6 -8  + max(@characteristics.dexterity.mod,@characteristics.intelligence.mod)\"\n* Change the modifier for a characteristic of 0 to -3 rather than -2\n* Switch to handling difficulties by changing the target number rather than adding/subtracting modifiers.\n* Rename 'advantage' to 'boon' and 'disadvantage' to 'bane'\n* Select CEL style autofire rules and make sure weapons have a single number for their 'Rate of Fire/Auto X' setting.\n* Set \"What effect (if above 0) is required for a throw to be considered a critical success/failure (i.e. be colored green/red).\" to 6.\n* Set encumbrance formula to \"2*(@characteristics.endurance.current + @characteristics.strength.current + max(0, @skills.AthleticsEndurance) + max(0, @skills.AthleticsStrength))\". Set the \"Fraction of maximum encumbrance when encumbrance roll modifier applies\" to 0.5\n* Set the \"Animals use hits for damage\" option to true.\n* Set \"Factor to multiply the weight value of a equipped armor.\" to 0.25\n* Set \"Animal Types are Independent of Niche\" to true.\n* Set \"Show degrees of success for non-attack rolls\" to \"Other\"\n\nCompendiums with skills, items, etc. cannot be included for licensing reasons, so you have to enter those yourself, except that the '2e skills' compendium is sufficiently close that it should be useful, even though it is not based on MGT2. (It is for https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/207738/Skills-List-2e which is an Open Gaming License Pay What You Want supplement for for Cepheus Engine - which is pretty much the Open Gaming License version of MGT1 - that provides a skill list that is very similar to the one in MGT2.)\n\n## Classic Traveller\nWith Twodsix v4.22 and beyond, basic support has been added for Classic Traveller (CT) as defined by _The Traveller Book_ (copy-write Far Future Enterprises-FFE).

This can be set as the default behavior in the settings (making shift-click instead open the full roll dialog).</p><p>* You can connect a skill to any item on a character, with an optional permanent bonus, so you can do 'skill rolls' (often enough weapon attacks) by clicking the item rather than the skill, and get that bonus added automatically.</p><p>* Another feature you need to turn on in system settings if you want to use it is to automatically roll damage for items that have a connected skill, roll a success (i.e. Effect of 0 or greater) and immediately roll damage. (I.e. Weapons.)</p><p>* You can drag damage rolls to a character-sheet or token (if option is enabled) and the damage is automatically applied to the character after subtracting any armor (but do note that after END runs out the damage always goes to the currently highest of STR and DEX, the target cannot currently choose which.) Or, by clicking shift when dragging you get a dialog that allows you to spread the damage manually.</p><p>* You can right-click on an actor on the map, and select as target (round button in the lower left corner). Now when you do an attack it will automatically bring up the damage dialog for that actor (i.e. you don't need to drag and drop the damage)</p><p>* There is built in support for _PDF Pager, Automated Animations, Autocomplete Inline Properties, Drag Ruler, Item Piles and Monk's Enhanced Journal_ modules. There is a separate mode to support Token Action HUB: https://github.com/marvin9257/fvtt-token-action-hud-twodsix</p><p>* Can drag a scene to ship actor to act as an attached deck plan.</p><p>* Option to use ProseMirror editor for larger text input fields.</p><p>* Dragging a vehicle actor to a ship component list creats a component copy of the vehicle. Name links to actor.</p><p>* Automatic wounded status indicators (along with roll modifiers) can be optional added through a setting.</p><p>* There is an NPC sheet that can be used for any traveller. Select under sheet settings.</p><p>* If using the show untrained skill, any roll that depends on a skill will default to untrained if no specific skill is selected.</p><p>* If the training notes contain a fraction (e.g., 1/5), the pie shown represents that fraction rather than the default 50 percent.</p><p>* Can now hide items on actor sheet that are stored on the ship by toggling the eyeball icon.</p><p>* Unconsciousness rolls (if made) now fixed at 8+ per all rules settings (not set to a specific difficulty).</p><p>* Unconscious and Dead condition icons only get applied if the actor has an active token.</p><p>* Note that skills can be set to not use any characteristic as modifiers, which is useful in some cases beyond Cepheus Light (like classic Traveller).</p>",

You shouldn't rename the table unless you know how to make the corresponding change in the macro script.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Specific Macro Descriptions</h2>\n<p>This section provides a brief description of what the macros do and how to use them.</p>\n<h3>Healing Macros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heal for GM or Player</strong> - This macro lets a character make a medicine check / skill roll to heal a player (first aid).  The player must have a medkit /medical kit.  A successful roll removes player damage per the effect of the roll.  The characteristic order of healing is, 'endurance', 'strength', 'dexterity'.  The \"multiplier\" constant in the macro is used to adjust the healing amount different rules sets (some rules multiply the effect to calculate the healed damage).  The default multiplier is 1.0 (at line 1).  This value can be changed to suit your rules set.  To run the macro as a GM, you must first target a token (the player being healed) on the current scene. Do this by right clicking the token and select the target button (the bullseye). Next, select the healer by left clicking on that player's token. Run the macro.  To run as the healing player, you just need to target the actor to be healed. <em>The macro will not work as a player unless you have \"owner\" permissions on the target.</em></li>\n<li><strong>First Aid</strong> - When the player wants to roll their own Medicine check but does not have permissions to change another character's health, this macro takes the <em>last</em> medicine check in the chat log and applies the healing effect.  It is run by the GM and the healed character must be targeted (as the similar macro above).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>NPC Parsers</h3>\n<p>These series of macros take the output of various, online character generators and convert that information into a format that is compatible with a twodsix actor.  While the title says NPC, the generated actor could also be used for a player.  The macros do their best job at matching skills to the installed skills compendiums.  However, cascaded skills are not handled very robustly at this time.  Another limitation of the skill matching is that the names must be an exact match.  For example, a case where the skill is listed on the webpage as \"Admin\" would not match a compendium skill listed as \"Administration\".  The macros try to correct some of these issues based on known naming differences.  But again are not robust to handle all possible name variants.  These importers are only meant for <em>one</em> character at a time.  Moreover, each has specific requirements for the text scope copied (described for each below).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2e Parser for Traveller Tools</strong> - This macro imports a character from <a href=\"https://travellertools.azurewebsites.net/\">https://travellertools.azurewebsites.net/</a>.  It defaults to the included 2e skills compendium. If it doesn't match a skill to an existing compendium entry it creates a new one for the actor.  To use it: a) run the macro,\nb) copy the portion of the page with the white background (please don't include the menu items at top in black, c) paste into the dialog window (including the bottom disclaimer), d) click the 'generate character' button.</li>\n<li><strong>Parser for CE 1001 Characters]</strong> - This macro imports from the site <a href=\"http://members.ozemail.com.au/~jonoreita/SupplementOne/Cepheus_Engine_1001_characters.html\">http://members.ozemail.com.au/~jonoreita/SupplementOne/Cepheus<em>Engine</em>1001_characters.html</a>. It only imports one character at a time and _you need to specify that skills are separated by a comma_. Do not change the \"dash\" separator between the skill and level. After downloading the character from the website, copy and paste the entire text into the macro window. You can process using either the Cepheus Engine or Cepheus Light compendiums.  The selection will change the list of included skills and items for the actor.  The translation of skills from CE to CL may not cover all cases. </li>\n<li><strong>CL Character Importer</strong> - This macro imports from the site <a href=\"https://cepheuslightgen.herokuapp.com/\">https://cepheuslightgen.herokuapp.com/</a>.  To use the macro, generate a character on the website and run the macro. Copy - paste all the text between the horizontal lines into the macro text window. Use the generate button to make the character. This particular macro defaults to the CL compendium for skills and items.  Note that the website is still under development and may break the importer at some point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Trade Goods Generator</h3>\n<p><strong>Trade Macro</strong> This macro generates a trade table of quantities and buy/sell prices for trade goods on a planet based on the the planets's UWP.   It uses two inputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UPP: universal planet profile for the location of the transaction (e.g. C898666-5)</li>\n<li>Trader offset: the DM due to the player characters skill in trading (e.g. broker, EDU, or SOC modifier). If none, enter zero.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to install all the rollable tables (from the system compendium of \"twodsix macro rolltables\") that define the goods available and the pricing rolls.  There are eight, total rollable tables (four for each rules set CE or CL).  The tables need to be imported (see section above \"Import a Rollable Table\").  Note that the tables for the goods listing have a very specific format that follows the tables layout in the rules.  Each item is tab delimited.</p>\n<p>Rolling for available goods can either be random (the default) or per the planet trade codes.  This behavior can be changed at line 5, by setting the RANDOM constant from “true” to “false”.  The DEBUG constant is for tracing errors by outputting intermediate calc to the console.  Leave this as false unless you want to make changes / get into the details of the calculations.</p>\n<p>Some things that this macro doesn’t handle -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Illegal goods are still part of the random roll of goods offered</li>\n<li>The sell and buy prices aren’t tied to one another, so there can be some odd pricing effects leading to arbitrage windfalls for the players.  This is how the rules work (as best I understand).</li>\n<li>The macro only uses planet trade codes for the Cepheus Light rules.  The Cepheus Engine have some minor differences for the trade code  \"Ba\" that could be added to the macro to make it more complete.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>UWP Translator</h3>\n<p>The <strong>UWP Translator</strong> macro takes a UWP code and generates a description based on that code.  This macro uses Rollable Tables found in the subfolder <a href=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/tree/master/user_macros/UWP%20Translator/UWP%20Tables%20json\">UWP Tables json</a> - so install those per the instructions above. There are eleven tables in total.  To run the macro, enter the 8 character UWP code (e.g. C898666-5) into the text field and press the OK button.  A popup window opens with the translation.</p>\n<p>Limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The macro is currently fixed to using the Cepheus Light UWP descriptions.  To change to Cepheus Engine, edit the lines starting at row 47 from </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>let UWPtables = [\n      \"Starport Type\", \"World Size - CL\", \"Atmosphere\", \"Hydrographics\",\n      \"Population\", \"Government\", \"Law Level - CL\", \"Tech Level - CL\"\n    ];</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>let UWPtables = [\n      \"Starport Type\", \"World Size - CE\", \"Atmosphere\", \"Hydrographics\",\n      \"Population\", \"Government\", \"Law Level - CE\", \"Tech Level - CE\"\n    ];</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Random Tables</h3>\n<p>These rollable tables in the Foundry VTT format implement two sets of encounter tables from the Cepheus Engine rules.  They need to be imported into your Foundry VTT world per the instructions above. These tables are not part of the compendiums nor macros but rather full roll tables that work as any other roll table in Foundry. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/blob/master/user_macros/Random%20Tables/fvtt-RollTable-Random_Encounters.json\">Random Encounters Table</a> implements the roll table appearing in <a href=\"https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/social-encounters.html\">Chapter 14 (Social Encounters)</a> of the CE SRD rules.  </li>\n<li>The subfolder <a href=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/tree/master/user_macros/Random%20Tables/Starship%20Encounters\">Starship Encounters</a> implements the cascading roll tables for Starship Encounters from the CE SRD rules in <a href=\"https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/starship-encounters.html#space-encounter-descriptions\">Chapter 15 (Starship Encounters)</a>. All the tables in the sub folder must be installed for the tables to work correctly. The main table is <a href=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/blob/master/user_macros/Random%20Tables/Starship%20Encounters/fvtt-RollTable-Starship_Encounters.json\">fvtt-RollTable-Starship_Encounters.json</a>- roll from that table.  The rest of the tables cascade from it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Import Cepheus SRD Subsector</h3>\n<p>This macro imports a subsector description using the SEC format and creates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new scene with the planets mapped using icons and displaying key system data</li>\n<li>A set of journal entires in a folder, linked by notes, that correspond to each planet UWP description.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is specifically designed to work with the subsector output from  https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/tools/subsector-generator.html</p>\n<p>Each planet icon has specific data shown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>12 o'clock: either the UWP for the planet or the trade codes (option selected by user on input window)</li>\n<li>3 o'clock: Bases icons.  These include gas giant (Jupiter), Naval (stars), scout (ship), and pirate (skull).</li>\n<li>6 o'clock: Planet/System name</li>\n<li>9 o'clock: Planet system allegiance code.  Color indicates zone (red or amber if applicable).</li>\n<li>Center Icon (and notes link): Planets are round circles with Starport Code in the middle.  Asteroids use an asteroid icon instead but also show the starport code.  The colors of planets correspond to certain trade codes: blue = water world, green = garden world, orange = fluid world, dark grey = barren world, gold/brown = desert, and light blue = ice capped.  The size of the circle is proportional to the planet size code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To use the macro: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the UWP tables, (folder in the system compendium \"twodsix macro rolltables\").</li>\n<li>Run the macro and paste the planet data into the text box.  It should be of the SEC format. Paste ONLY the text where the planet(s) is/are defined (not the format information), e.g. \"Diavlo        0101 D7B1000-7   Ba, Fl           A  010 Na\". The input can handle multiple lines. <em>Note that if system names are multiple words, these won't display correctly. Use an underscore instead of spaces, e.g. \"Long Name becomes \"Long</em>Name\"._</li>\n<li>Select the UWP or Trade Codes button (this chooses what information is shown at the 12 o'clock position)</li>\n<li>Wait - eventually the new planets should show up in a new scene \"Temp Scene\", which you should rename.  The planet icons are note links to journal descriptions, which are placed in a new folder \"Export Folder\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to edit the notes/icons, you will need to have the \"Pin Cushion\" module installed and enabled. <em>Please make certain that notes display toggle is \"true\".</em></p>\n<p>A version (Cepheus Deluxe Galaxy Importer) is also available to import Cepheus Deluxe Galaxy output.  To use, install the same tables per above. Then, copy and paste the table text on the right-hand side of a subsector for CDG - <em>omitting</em> the header row. </p>\n<p><em>Please be aware that the macro assumes that the input matches the expected format and that there is no error messaging or correction.</em></p>\n<h3>Apply Wound Status icons for Cepheus Deluxe</h3>\n<p>(<em><strong>This feature is now implemented in the system - files kept for backwards compatibility</strong></em>)</p>\n<h3>CD Animal Reaction</h3>\n<p>This macro implements an animal reaction roll per Cepheus Deluxe rules.</p>\n<h3>Roll Table with DM</h3>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/blob/master/user_macros/Roll%20from%20Table%20with%20DM\">macro</a> - provides an example macro to make RollTable roll with a user input dice modifier.  To adapt, change the table name on line 23.</p>\n<p><em>to be continued</em></p>",

The colors of planets correspond to certain trade codes: blue = water world, green = garden world, orange = fluid world, dark grey = barren world, gold/brown = desert, and light blue = ice capped.  The size of the circle is proportional to the planet size code.\n\nTo use the macro: \n1. Install the UWP tables, (folder in the system compendium \"twodsix macro rolltables\").\n1. Run the macro and paste the planet data into the text box.  It should be of the SEC format. Paste ONLY the text where the planet(s) is/are defined (not the format information), e.g. \"Diavlo        0101 D7B1000-7   Ba, Fl           A  010 Na\". The input can handle multiple lines. _Note that if system names are multiple words, these won't display correctly. Use an underscore instead of spaces, e.g. \"Long Name becomes \"Long_Name\"._\n1. Select the UWP or Trade Codes button (this chooses what information is shown at the 12 o'clock position)\n1. Wait - eventually the new planets should show up in a new scene \"Temp Scene\", which you should rename.  The planet icons are note links to journal descriptions, which are placed in a new folder \"Export Folder\".\n\nIf you want to edit the notes/icons, you will need to have the \"Pin Cushion\" module installed and enabled. _Please make certain that notes display toggle is \"true\"._\n\nA version (Cepheus Deluxe Galaxy Importer) is also available to import Cepheus Deluxe Galaxy output.  To use, install the same tables per above. Then, copy and paste the table text on the right-hand side of a subsector for CDG - _omitting_ the header row. \n\n_Please be aware that the macro assumes that the input matches the expected format and that there is no error messaging or correction._\n\n### Apply Wound Status icons for Cepheus Deluxe\n\n(_**This feature is now implemented in the system - files kept for backwards compatibility**_)\n\n### CD Animal Reaction \nThis macro implements an animal reaction roll per Cepheus Deluxe rules.\n\n### Roll Table with DM\nThis [macro](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/blob/master/user_macros/Roll%20from%20Table%20with%20DM) - provides an example macro to make RollTable roll with a user input dice modifier.  To adapt, change the table name on line 23.\n\n_to be continued_"

To change the strength value for an actor, the attribute key would be \"system.characteristics.strength.value\".  To change a skill, use the \"Simplified Skill Name\" that appears on the skill sheet.  For example, \"Gun Combat\" would have a key of \"system.skills.GunCombat\".

However as the order of calculation is set by FVTT, you may get unexpected results if you mix override and add effects.</p>\n<h1>CUSTOM Change Mode</h1>\n<p>The CUSTOM mode for active effects is now supported.  By default, the CUSTOM mode <em>adds</em> a value based on a valid, deterministic (no dice terms) roll formula.  ~Also, no derived values (e.g. @system.characteristics.strength.mod) may be used in the calculations.~  For example, <code>(@system.characteristics.strength.value - 8)/2</code> as an effect value will subtract 8 from the actor's base strength value then divide by two.  <em>The result of this math is subsequently added to the specified key for the ActiveEffect.  Note that it may be possible to create circular references.  Please be cautious when using this mode.</em></p>\n<p>As of version 4.24 of Twodsix, the way CUSTOM mode modifies the key value can be specified (similar to a regular active effect).  A <code>+</code> prefix to the formula (or no operator) adds the roll formula.  An <code>=</code> prefix OVERRIDES the key value with the formula.  A <code>*</code> or <code>/</code> prefix multiplies or divides respectively.</p>\n<p>As of version 6.0.10 of Twodsix, CUSTOM mode may now include derived data in the formula.  However, this means all CUSTOM calculations occur <em>after</em> any other AE calculations.  So CUSTOM calculations will always have a higher priority in calculations.  If you use multiple AE's for the same attribute and priority of the calculations matter, use CUSTOM mode for all the calculations for that attribute.</p>\n<p>As an example of how this might be useful -\nSupposed you have powered armor that adds +4 to strength and dexterity values but only for the purposes of rolls and encumbrance (not hit points).  You can modify the effects for the powered armor by changing the mod values for strength and dexterity and adding to the max encumbrance.  For the example, encumbrance formula is <code>3 * (7 + @characteristics.strength.mod)</code> It will look like:</p>\n<p><img width=\"698\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 2 36 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/a28ec854-4c4e-4039-9254-4e9e155793c7\" /></p>\n<p>The formulas are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>system.characteristics.strength.mod</code> : <code>=floor((@system.characteristics.strength.value + 4 - 6)/3)</code></li>\n<li><code>system.characteristics.dexterity.mod</code> : <code>=floor((@system.characteristics.dexterity.value + 4 - 6)/3)</code></li>\n<li><code>system.encumbrance.max</code>: <code>=(floor((@system.characteristics.strength.value + 4 - 6)/3) + 7)*3</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Active on an actor:</p>\n<p><img width=\"824\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-26 at 11 27 30 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/84c6b295-25c8-4e9a-8fc9-06222967a513\" /></p>\n<h1>Active Effects on Skills</h1>\n<p>Skills are embedded items on the actor in Twodsix.  Thus, there isn't a direct way to change them.  However, actors have a 'getter' object for skill level under the data path <code>system.skills</code> where the keys of the object are the Simplified Skill Name for the skill and the value is the level.  To find the simplified skill name, open the skill sheet from the actor and note the simplified skill name.</p>\n<p><img width=\"548\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 8 19 56 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f0f14e-5dc0-4498-83a2-ffb035ff048a\" /></p>\n<p>Then, create the effect using this simplified name as follows (be certain to include the system prefix):</p>\n<p><img width=\"581\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 8 21 51 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93d503a7-0f28-488b-a65b-6befd93d9c12\" /></p>\n<p>On the skill list, you should now see an \"adjusted\" value for the skill level based on the active effect.  This is the new value for the skill using the AE.</p>\n<p><img width=\"534\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 8 23 18 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92895779-923d-452f-86d7-6312c7fed779\" /></p>\n<h1>Active Effects and Initiative Rolls</h1>\n<p>There is no init value on the actor as it is a combatant attribute.

This can lead to some odd results in calculating the final value if multiple AE's affect <code>system.encumbrance.max</code>.  To avoid such issues, version 6.9+ now includes and <code>system.encumbrance.offset</code> value which is directly added to the <code>system.encumbrance.max</code> calculation.  This attribute is only accessible through active effects or macros.  For example, an AE may be affecting maximum encumbrance through an item (e.g. power armor) and also there is an actor effect that changes STR.mod (due to gravity). In such a situation, the offset value is helpful.</p>",

        "content": "<h1>Basics</h1>\n<p>With release v4.7.0, Twodsix now includes a basic ability to include range modifiers for weapon attack rolls. This feature only works for an active combat scene where there are tokens on a map.  If using theater of the mind, modifiers will need to be added manually.  To use this feature, at least one token must be targeted before rolling the attack.  If no token is selected, no range modifiers are calculated and the roll happens as it normally does. There is a new rules setting (under Advanced Rules Settings -&gt; General) that configures the calculation method for the modifier base on different rules (described later).</p>\n<h1>Limitations</h1>\n<p>Twodsix makes a number of simplifications to make the calculations feasible across the various rulesets.  The most important of these simplifications to understand is that the calculations in Twodsix always apply a range modifier (e.g. -2) to the roll rather than changing the difficulty.  For example, the Cepheus Deluxe rules change the roll difficulty from average to difficult if the range is between optimal and maximum.  Twodsix would impose a -2 penalty to the roll, instead.  This approach is functionally equivalent to changing the difficulty and has the added advantage of making all the range modifier calculations similar across the rulesets.</p>\n<p>Other limitations is that for the calculations to be applied, </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If more than one token is targeted, the range modifier is calculated for each roll.  <em>However, the range modifier does not appear in the roll dialog when multiple targets are selected (since it may be different for each target)</em>.</li>\n<li>The actor making the attack roll can have <em>one</em> token on the active scene. If an actor controls multiple tokens, the system doesn't know which token to use for range calculations. For such cases, no range modifier is calculated.</li>\n<li>A GM must select <em>one</em> active token for the roll for the modifier to be computed.</li>\n<li>The range to the target is calculated based on the grid distance (e.g. the number of squares times the square size) and not the Euclidean distance.

        "markdown": "# Basics\nWith release v4.7.0, Twodsix now includes a basic ability to include range modifiers for weapon attack rolls. This feature only works for an active combat scene where there are tokens on a map.  If using theater of the mind, modifiers will need to be added manually.  To use this feature, at least one token must be targeted before rolling the attack.  If no token is selected, no range modifiers are calculated and the roll happens as it normally does. There is a new rules setting (under Advanced Rules Settings -> General) that configures the calculation method for the modifier base on different rules (described later).\n\n# Limitations\nTwodsix makes a number of simplifications to make the calculations feasible across the various rulesets.  The most important of these simplifications to understand is that the calculations in Twodsix always apply a range modifier (e.g. -2) to the roll rather than changing the difficulty.  For example, the Cepheus Deluxe rules change the roll difficulty from average to difficult if the range is between optimal and maximum.  Twodsix would impose a -2 penalty to the roll, instead.  This approach is functionally equivalent to changing the difficulty and has the added advantage of making all the range modifier calculations similar across the rulesets.\n\nOther limitations is that for the calculations to be applied, \n* If more than one token is targeted, the range modifier is calculated for each roll.  _However, the range modifier does not appear in the roll dialog when multiple targets are selected (since it may be different for each target)_.\n* The actor making the attack roll can have _one_ token on the active scene. If an actor controls multiple tokens, the system doesn't know which token to use for range calculations. For such cases, no range modifier is calculated.\n* A GM must select _one_ active token for the roll for the modifier to be computed.\n* The range to the target is calculated based on the grid distance (e.g. the number of squares times the square size) and not the Euclidean distance.  This measurement matches how the FVTT ruler works. \n\n# Calculation Methods\n## Types\nThere are four different range modifier calculation methods included with Twodsix.  These methods covers the various rulesets included and the appropriate one is automatically set when an included ruleset is chosen (although it can be overridden).\n1. None - This method ignores the range modifier calculation.\n2. Cepheus Engine Bands - This is the Cepheus Engine approach for calculating range modifiers (https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/personal-combat.html#range). Briefly, each weapon is classified with a weapon type under the \"Range Band\" field.  The distance to target is also classified in a band.\n\n  <img width=\"439\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 11 45 45 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/d96e7d57-9bbe-4923-a370-8411ca549bb4\">\n\n  The Range Band field on the weapon is now a select option rather than a freeform text field (_note any existing weapons will need to have this field updated to work_).

An additional field of 'None' has been added to the list; this selection does not apply any range modifier.\n\n3. Classic Traveller Bands - This method follows the calculations for Classic Traveller ruleset based on _The Traveller Book_.

Twodsix uses the following conventions for short ranges:\n* A zero value for range means zero range or the same square\n* An empty value (nothing entered) means to skip the range modifier calculation (a zero modifier)\n* If using a standard Traveller grid, 1.5m is the dimension of one square.
