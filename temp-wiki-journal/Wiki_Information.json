For example, adding the text (while editing) `[[/r 2d6\\]]` will create a button that makes a roll with two, six-sided dice.

See this page (https://foundryvtt.com/article/journal/) under &quot;Dynamic Document Links.&quot;\n\n# Custom Enhancers for Twodsix\nTwodsix currently has three custom enhancers that extend the core FVTT capability.  These enhancers are @DisplayTable, @SkillRoll, and @ItemList.\n## @DisplayTable\nNormal dragging and dropping of a Roll Table onto a Journal Entry page creates a link that opens that table.  The @DisplayTable option will instead display the table in a html formatted table.  For example, displaying one of the compendium macro tables will look like this,\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;601&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 8 42 47 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/d5ba0742-0c20-42cc-8007-4f6d42866f73&quot;&gt;\n\nThe format for the enhancer is `@DisplayTable[UUID or Table Name]{Text Label}`.  The easiest way to create this display is to drag and drop the table.  You should see a UUID link something like `@UUID[RollTable.u8586ms09wZNqpwN]{Population}`.  Change the @UUID prefix to @DisplayTable: `@DisplayTable[RollTable.u8586ms09wZNqpwN]{Population}`.  Subtables are displayed as the default `@UUID[Rolltable.uuid]{optional description}` link.\n\n## @Table\nThis enricher creates a button to directly roll a table result without displaying the table.  It has the format `@Table[Rolltable.uuid]{optional description}`.  As per @DisplayTable, the easiest way to create is to drag-drop the table into the editor and replace @UUID with @Table.\n\n## @SkillRoll\nThe @SkillRoll feature creates a clickable skill roll similar to the way skill rolls work for ship positions (https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/How-to-use-the-ship-sheet#positions-tab) except that there are no components to link.  The general format is `@SkillRoll[skill name | alt skill name / CHR #+]{Custom Text}`.  For example, this string `@SkillRoll[Zero-G/DEX 10+]{Zero-G Test}` creates a button label &#39;Zero-G Test&#39; and rolls a skill check for the Zero-G skill using dexterity characteristic and a difficulty threshold of 10+ (very difficult or difficult - depending on rules).  Note that the characteristic and difficulty terms are optional.  The skill&#39;s default values for characteristic modifier and difficulty are used when nothing is specified in the formula. \n\nIf `None` is entered for the skill, the click will make a characteristic roll. The CHR string should be the abbreviation shown on the actor sheet.  So if the characteristic label has been customized, use that custom label in the formula.\n\nFor difficulty values that are odd, e.g. 5+, the code chooses the next highest difficulty and adds a custom +1 DM. A player&#39;s default character is used for the skill roll actor/context data.  As a GM, the _selected_ character is used for the roll.\n\n## @ItemList\nThe @ItemList feature creates a drag / droppable list of items that can be added to an actor.  This is a connivence to quickly drop a collection of items (of mixed types) - for example a character package with initial skills and items. The general format is `@ItemList itemRef1, itemRef2, ...`, where &#39;itemRef&#39; can be an item name or UUID.  For example, `@ItemList Auto Pistol , Cloth, Item.8l6XwFOpHSDCO8tV,Item.pZ8gc26I9shWaAax, Compendium.twodsix.cepheus-deluxe-items.Item.bwjiHCfwS9naDUVy`.  UUID&#39;s can be easily accessed from an item sheet by clicking on the passport icon in the header. This copies the fill UUID to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into the JournalEntry.

If the foundry VTT is not set up, please see the following links--https://foundryvtt.com/article/installation/ and https://foundryvtt.com/article/tutorial/. There is a pay to play version of foundry vtt known as forge (https://forge-vtt.com/). This tutorial will be written from the perspective of someone using forge vtt.\n\nAfter the administrative side of things is complete (creating your account, server) the first step will be to launch your world. \n\nNext you need to download/install the game system. Click on the Game Systems tab and search for &quot;twodsix.&quot; Click install. Note, the system does not update automatically, so it will require you to manually click check for update and then update. \n\nNow that the core game system is installed, click on create your world (image). Here you will have to give a name to the world, a name to the data path and select a system. In this case, the system is twodsix. Click create world (image). Now the world can be launched, so click launch world. \n\nYou will be presented with the world setup screen. To enter the world, a role needs to be selected, so select gamemaster and click join game session. \n\nThe actual VTT will now be presented. The place any referee should go is to game settings, which is the final tab (image). In this case the referee must go there, as compendiums (an essential aspect of the VTT) will not be enabled otherwise. Note: compendiums are already enabled, so x out the banner. \n\nClick on configure settings.  Here are the game variations that can be chosen, subjects such as auto rolling for damage, initiative order, automatic weapons and so on. You can also choose the game rules that will be used. Default is cepheus engine. \n\nNext of note are the compendiums (the second to last tab). These compendiums are not exhaustive and for Mongoose Traveller content, this will need to create this yourself. \n\nTo create a character, go to the fourth tab. Click on create actor. It will need a name and a type. In our case, the name is Rufus and the type is traveller. \n\nThe character sheet is largely as would be experienced on the table top, with inventory, skills, and characteristics. As well, what you see is what you get, so if there is an alternative SOC characteristic, for example, you will need to just pretend SOC says something else. Characteristics will automatically apply modifiers, so if you put in a 15 for STR your modifier will be a +3. The red 0 under the characteristic is for temporary stat loss. Apply the number lost here and the charactersheet will update automatically. If Rufus were to take 14 points of damage to strength his modifier will now become a -2. \n\nTo give skills to Rufus, open the skills compendium of choice (in this case, 2e skills) and drag and drop. \n\nYou will note the prodigious strength of Rufus does not apply to Athletics: Strength in the above screenshot. Click on the pen and paper to edit. Now defaults can be set, to give Rufus ranks in this skill and to set strength as the default characteristic. In this case, the default is STR and Rufus has 5 ranks. Note: Any changes here will be the default, so to make the check formidable and with disadvantage for Rufus, it is better to do so when rolling the skill.\n\nTo roll the skill, click on the name. A box will appear and here is where the difficulty of the task can be changed, advantage/disadvantage applied, temporary modifiers and the visibility of the roll. (all of these will get their own wiki page). In our case, Rufus is rolling a formidable check with disadvantage. To see the result, go to the dialogue tab. To see what he actually rolled, click on the formula or number. In this instance for Rufus you will see that he rolled 4, 6 and 2 and lost the 6 due to disadvantage. You will also see that this is a roll without effect; to enable effect navigate to system settings and selec &quot;show effect or total roll value&quot;--now with a re-roll effect is calculated in the end roll.

        "markdown": "(Note--I am not done, I am in the process of uploading pictures)\n\nAssumptions: You are the referee/gamemaster, and you have already set up the basics of your foundry virtual table top (hereafter known as VTT). If the foundry VTT is not set up, please see the following links--https://foundryvtt.com/article/installation/ and https://foundryvtt.com/article/tutorial/. There is a pay to play version of foundry vtt known as forge (https://forge-vtt.com/). This tutorial will be written from the perspective of someone using forge vtt.\n\nAfter the administrative side of things is complete (creating your account, server) the first step will be to launch your world. \n\nNext you need to download/install the game system. Click on the Game Systems tab and search for \"twodsix.\" Click install. Note, the system does not update automatically, so it will require you to manually click check for update and then update. \n\nNow that the core game system is installed, click on create your world (image). Here you will have to give a name to the world, a name to the data path and select a system. In this case, the system is twodsix. Click create world (image). Now the world can be launched, so click launch world. \n\nYou will be presented with the world setup screen. To enter the world, a role needs to be selected, so select gamemaster and click join game session. \n\nThe actual VTT will now be presented. The place any referee should go is to game settings, which is the final tab (image). In this case the referee must go there, as compendiums (an essential aspect of the VTT) will not be enabled otherwise. Note: compendiums are already enabled, so x out the banner. \n\nClick on configure settings.  Here are the game variations that can be chosen, subjects such as auto rolling for damage, initiative order, automatic weapons and so on. You can also choose the game rules that will be used. Default is cepheus engine. \n\nNext of note are the compendiums (the second to last tab). These compendiums are not exhaustive and for Mongoose Traveller content, this will need to create this yourself. \n\nTo create a character, go to the fourth tab. Click on create actor. It will need a name and a type. In our case, the name is Rufus and the type is traveller. \n\nThe character sheet is largely as would be experienced on the table top, with inventory, skills, and characteristics. As well, what you see is what you get, so if there is an alternative SOC characteristic, for example, you will need to just pretend SOC says something else. Characteristics will automatically apply modifiers, so if you put in a 15 for STR your modifier will be a +3. The red 0 under the characteristic is for temporary stat loss. Apply the number lost here and the charactersheet will update automatically. If Rufus were to take 14 points of damage to strength his modifier will now become a -2. \n\nTo give skills to Rufus, open the skills compendium of choice (in this case, 2e skills) and drag and drop. \n\nYou will note the prodigious strength of Rufus does not apply to Athletics: Strength in the above screenshot. Click on the pen and paper to edit. Now defaults can be set, to give Rufus ranks in this skill and to set strength as the default characteristic. In this case, the default is STR and Rufus has 5 ranks. Note: Any changes here will be the default, so to make the check formidable and with disadvantage for Rufus, it is better to do so when rolling the skill.\n\nTo roll the skill, click on the name. A box will appear and here is where the difficulty of the task can be changed, advantage/disadvantage applied, temporary modifiers and the visibility of the roll. (all of these will get their own wiki page). In our case, Rufus is rolling a formidable check with disadvantage. To see the result, go to the dialogue tab.

        "content": "# Intro\nThere are several ways to apply damage/healing to an actor that is either a Traveller, Animal or Robot.  Ships and vehicle damage require manual adjustment of the actor sheet due to the diversity of damage mechanisms in the rules sets. Note that the damage characteristics vary by rules set, as well.  To simplify for this page, we will focus on the three physical characteristics (STR, DEX, END) in the examples.  For rules where there are other damage stats (e.g. Cepheus Deluxe with Stamina and Lifeblood), the same principles apply.\n\n# Editing the Actor Sheet\nEditing the damage fields on actor sheet is the most direct way to apply damage / healing.  All characteristics have at least two values, a base value (the value when the actor is 100% healthy) and a damage value (shown in a red font, is the amount of damage that characteristic has sustained).  The image below shows the standard stats block.  STR (strength) has a base value of 6 with 1 point of damage - so the current strength is 5.  The resulting modifier is -1 for that characteristic value of 5. Similarly, DEX has a base value of 7 with 2 points of damage (the resulting modifier is also -1 for a current value of 5).\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;267&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-06-16 at 7 48 16 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/7f6a56dd-00ca-4eab-ad9d-71c037b5227b&quot;&gt;\n\nTo add an additional 2 points of damage to the STR characteristic, change the red number from 1 to 3.\n\n# Dropping a Damage Card\nWhen a successful roll results from a weapons skill check (when the automatic roll damage setting is set to true) or damage is rolled manually from a the weapons listing on the player sheet (by clicking on the damage field in the listing), a damage card appears in chat.  An example is,\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;284&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-06-16 at 7 59 28 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/2bb28125-18b2-4e41-ab6e-0c7b4e8fc38f&quot;&gt;\n\nThis card holds all the data necessary to apply damage to an actor.  Simply drag and drop the red box onto an open actor sheet and a dialog should appear with information on how to apply the damage.  If you don&#39;t want to see the dialog but just have the damage automatically applied, hold the shift key while dragging and dropping.\n\nYou can also drag and drop damage onto a actor token when this experimental setting is enabled.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;580&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-06-16 at 8 05 40 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/70ece819-5021-4e8e-991c-33202989fa70&quot;&gt;\n\n# Editing Token Hits Value\nIf you right-click a token, an interface menu appears as shown below.\n \n&lt;img width=&quot;84&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-06-16 at 8 07 57 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/9fb3bd07-5f25-4eab-b1e0-ed158d477b4f&quot;&gt;\n\nThe box below the token image is the &quot;hits&quot; field, which is the sum of all the damage characteristics minus the current damage.  It is the number of additional hits the actor can sustain without dying.  In the image above, the token has 27 hit points left.  To add damage to the actor, click in the hits box and type in a negative number, e.g. -5.  This will subtract this many hit points from the various damage characteristics. Note that this is done automatically so no damage dialog will appear.  To heal the actor, enter a number preceded by a plus sign, e.g. +6.  A value of +6 will heal the actor by six points - again applied automatically.\n\n# Targeting a Token Before Making a Weapon Skill Check\nDamage can also be applied automatically when making a successful weapon skill check by targeting another token(s) prior to rolling.  Multiple tokens may be targeted; however, the weapon action must have multiple attacks. Tokens are selected in the order that they were targeted.  As with other damage application methods, automatically rolling damage setting must be enabled.  If a successful weapons skills check is made, the damage popup dialog will appear to apply damage to the target token, by default.  There is a setting to prevent the pop up and automatically apply damage (&quot;Auto Damage Targets&quot;). _Please note that if using the &quot;Auto Damage Targets&quot; setting, only damage rolled by the GM will be applied.  Players do not have permission to change actors they don&#39;t own._\n\n# Chat Card Context Menu\nAnother way to apply damage or healing from any roll is to _select_ any tokens to apply the damage or healing (this is not the same as targeting).  Next, right-click the roll chat card with the damage/healing value.  The roll does not need to be a damage roll, it can be any roll with a result that is greater than zero.  After right-clicking, a context menu appears:\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;288&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-06-16 at 8 33 31 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/b2f8cf3e-4378-4a3c-ba95-55be57a0fdd1&quot;&gt;\n\nThere are four options to apply damage/healing:\n* Apply damage applies the damage value to the actor and open the damage dialog (for all selected tokens)\n* Apply destructive damage is similar to above but multiplies the damage by 10.\n* Apply scale reduced damage divides the damage value by 10\n* Apply healing applies the value as healing (even if from a damage card).  A dialog appears if auto damage/heal setting is not enabled.\n\nThe value used for the above actions depends on the type of chat card selected.  For a damage card, the damage/healing value used is the damage value for the card (and any chosen multiplier).  For a skill roll, the value is the effect value.  For a manual roll, the roll total is used.\n# Macros\nThe actor method &#39;applyDamage&#39; is open to macros where you have an actor reference, e.g. `_token.actor.damageActor({damageValue: 1, armorPiercingValue: 9999, damageType: &quot;NONE&quot;, damageLabel: &quot;NONE&quot;, canBeParried: false}, false)` applies one point of damage to the selected token from the console.  The fields are damage payload object and whether to show the damage dialog (boolean).  The damage payload object has the format:\n`{`\n    `damageValue: integer, (the value of damage apply, negative is healing)`\n    `armorPiercingValue: integer, (the amount of armor to bypass)`\n    `damageType: string, (type of damage, system dependent and affects secondary armor)`\n    `damageLabel: string, (freeform label describing damage)`\n    `canBeParried: boolean, (whether attack can be parried)`\n`}`",

This will open up a new window with options of Name: Type: and Folder: \n\nName and Folder are user options and can be as you wish. The Type option gives a drop down of either Character or Ship; you need to choose ship. This will create a new actor in your selected folder.\n\nLeft clicking on the name of the new ship will open up the ship sheet\n\nTop left hand corner of the sheet show the ship’s image. This can be changed by clicking on the image or via various modules such as Art Galley, just as you would for an actor’s Character sheet.  The image is not usable with Tokenizer.\n\nTo the right of the image is the name as selected when the sheet was created. This can be edited from the sheet.\n\nAlso to the right of the image there are a number of data fields \n* Displacement - The hull size (displacement) defined during the build process.  It represents the maximum mass the ship can carry.\n* TL - the technical level for the ship\n* Jump - the jump drive rating for the ship (in parsecs / hexes)\n* Thrust - the thrust rating for the m-drive in G\n* Fuel - current and maximum fuel available.  Currently, this field is a manually updated.  The bar can be clicked to toggle the label between &quot;Refined&quot; and &quot;Unrefined&quot;.\n* Overdrive - a checkbox to indicate ship is in overdrive\n* Ship Hull - current and max hull points designated during the build process, according to which rule set you have opted for\n* Armor - type of armor installed (description) and the current and max armor points\n* Power management or Power and Weight Management section that contains further data on ship components\n\n### Power management\n  * Power Used and Max generated (based on all installed and operating power components)\n  * Systems - all systems power usage other than dives, sensors and weapons components\n  * M-Drive - sum of power draw for all drive components with &quot;m-Drive&quot; or &quot;m drive&quot; in name\n  * J-Drive - sum of power draw for all drive components with &quot;j-Drive&quot; or &quot;j drive&quot; in name\n  * Sensors - all sensor components power usage\n  * Weapons - all weapons components power usage\n\n_Note that power is only included for those components that have an on or damaged status.  Also, power draw / generated is assumed to be per unit.  So the calculation of the total power used by a component is the quantity * power draw/generated_\n\n### Power and Weight Management\n  * Power Used and Max generated (based on all installed and operating components (consumed show as used and generated show as max)\n  * Systems - total weight for all systems that are not cargo, fuel, or vehicle components\n  * Cargo - the total weight for all cargo components\n  * Fuel - the total weight for all fuel components\n  * Vehicles - the total weight for all vehicle components\n  * Avail. (Available) - weight (mass) available to be carried by the ship.  It is equal to the displacement minus the total mass of components.\n\n\nBelow these you will find a tab bar showing:\n* Crew\n* Components\n* Locker\n* Cargo\n* Finances\n* Notes\n\n## Tabs\n**Positions:** This allows the creation of ship’s stations predominantly, but not limited to, use during ship to ship combat\n\n**Crew:** Shows the crew roster\n\n**Components:** The different component parts of the ship as described in the build process\n\n**Locker:** The ship locker and allow the cataloging of equipment stored in the Ship’s Locker \n\n**Cargo** The manifest of cargo components and notes for tracking cargo\n\n**Finance:** A basic text field to allow the tracking of funds.  At the top are the ship hull&#39;s basic costs: purchase value, 40-year mortgage value, and monthly maintenance costs.  If auto calc is enabled, these values are calculated based on the component data.  Otherwise the fields are manual entry.\n\n**Notes:** This is a simple text box to allow the GM or player to add reference notes about the given ship\n\nThe ship sheet is under review and development and many of these current sections or for tracking purposes only with manual input. The **Positions** tab does enable some automation as described below\n\n## Positions Tab\nClicking on the Positions tab will show a box allowing the creation of a bespoke position/station for the ship’s crew\n\nClick on the +  sign (Add Ship Position) and a new new position will be created\n\nClicking on the spanner icon will open a new window:\n\n**Position Name:** As it says on the tin, type in chosen name for the position eg Sensor Op, Captain, etc Order: A simple numeric value to show the order of the positions shown on the ship sheet, ie. 1 will be top left , 2 will be top center, 3 top right \n\n**Travellers:** This section is where crew members can be assigned. Travellers and robots are valid actor types.  If you are the GM or a player with permission to create new tokens, you can drag and drop the Character from the sidebar tab. Players without this permission may attach an actor by selecting the plus button.  A pop-up opens for the play to select _one_ of their owned actors to attach to the position.\n\n**Actions:** click on the + and it will add a new action. \n* **Order** is a numeric value again showing position\n* **Name**  (New Action by default) name the action e.g. Electronic Warfare, Command and Control, Fire Beam Laser\n* **Macro/Skill** This is what is given to the action type\n  * For &quot;Chat&quot; it is simply what should be outputted in the chat when executing the action.  You can also specify a roll formula by starting the chat string with &#39;/r&#39; or &#39;/R&#39;. The action will make a chat roll as the normal chat box when the roll formula is valid. Note that two contexts (for roll data) are available. The `@` prefix will generally access any selected actor roll data (e.g. `@skills.Tactics`).  To access the ship roll data, prefix the element using `@ship`, (e.g. `@ship.combatPosition`).\n  * For &quot;Skill Roll&quot; The skill name has to be provided. Optionally one can also override the default characteristic for that skill or override the difficulty. The skill name will need to be as typed on the character sheet with the same capital, space etc  e.g. `Electronics (Sensors)`. If you want to override the characteristic add `/CHR` after the skill name, for example `Electronics (Sensors)/INT`. To override the difficulty you add it by typing a space and a number followed by a plus, e.g. `Electronics (Sensors) 10+`. You can both override the characteristic and difficulty at the same time as well (`Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+`).  Multiple skills and multiple characteristics can be configured by separating them with the pipe &quot;|&quot; character.  The most advantageous skill and/or characteristic for the Actor will be used by the action.  A hull repair action might be configured as `Engineering|Mechanic/INT|EDU 6+`.\n  * For &quot;Fire Energy Weapons&quot; you put in a skill (as described above) and select a component to use in the &quot;Component to use&quot; dropdown to the right. Currently, this feature is quite limited and will make a skill roll and output as a chat message that you hit with the component that was given. The format is the same as a skill roll, e.g. `Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+` (the characteristic and difficulty is optional). Note that the old style of specifying a component (by appending an &quot;=COMPONENT_ID&quot;) still works.\n  * For &quot;Execute Macro&quot;, you enter the name of the macro you want to execute.  The following documents are passed as context to the macro to make creating the macro easier.  `actor` is the selected actor document for the position.  `ship` is the ship document. `component` is the selected component.\n* **Component to use** drop down list of the non-cargo components to use for Fire Energy Weapons or Skill Roll.\n* **Action Type** drop down list for the action types described above (Chat, Skill Roll, Fire Energy Weapon, or Execute Macro).\n\nThis process will need to be done for each position. Each position can have single or multiple action and is totally bespoke \n\nOnce positions are created the Character can be dragged to the new position. This will link all actions to the individual character and utilise their skills for the action. \n\nA position can have more than one Character but a Character can only be at one given position at a time. To remove the Character from the position either drag him/her to another position or to remove totally drag to a neutral area of the ship sheet (do not drag over to the screen/canvas as this will place the token there)\n\n## Component Data\nThe component data is used to auto calculate ship weight, power and cost information (if the option is enabled).  To make such calculations work correctly, one needs to understand some important concepts. Key to all these calculations is the hull displacement value (ship size).  Several calculations need this value to work correctly, so it is important to enter a displacement value in the upper right corner of the main sheet.\n\n### Component Weight\nWeight is assumed to be per unit.  So the calculation of the total power used by a component is the quantity * unit weight.  For armament and fuel, the calculation uses available quantity and not total quantity. However, unit weight may also be expressed as a percentage of the ship displacement weight (e.g. armor).  To calculate using percentage, enter the percentage form (e.g. 10 for 10%) and check the box &quot;Weight is Percentage?&quot;.  For example, this calculation method is the typical method for components such as drives.  For systems such as Cepheus Deluxe, the percentage value to enter can be a bit tricky as there is both a base percentage and a scaling factor due to TL.  For example, a TL 11, m-drive rated at 2G has a base weight of 1.5% of the hull displacement and an associated scaling factor of 1.1.  The % displacement weight value to enter on the component sheet is 1.65 (1.5*1.1).\n\nFor hull components, there is a special designation possible: &quot;Is Baseline Hull?&quot; (a checkbox).  If this box checked, the calculations assume that the component designates the displacement of the hull and the weight is not included as part of the carrying capacity (as it defines the maximum carrying capacity).  If autocalc is enabled and there is no valid displacement value entered, the sheet will fill in a displacement value based on a hull component that is the baseline hull.\n\n### Component Power\nA component may either consume power or generate it.  The default is that a component consumes power unless it is a power component (then it assumes it generates power).  The &quot;Generates Power?&quot; checkbox may be changed to override these defaults.  For the single-line components listing, power generating components are listed with a &quot;+&quot; before their power values.\n\n### Component Price\nThere are four different ways to calculate a component price:\n1. &quot;MCr per unit&quot;: This method prices a component as the price value entered times the total quantity.\n2. &quot;MCr per component ton&quot;: This method prices a component as the price value entered times the component&#39;s weight. Note that this weight may be dependent on the hull displacement, so it is important to enter a valid displacement value.\n3. &quot;MCr per hull ton&quot;: This method prices a component as the price value entered times the hull&#39;s displacement weight.  Again, a valid displacement value is necessary.\n4. &quot;MCr per 100 hull ton&quot;: Similar to the above method, for each 100 tons and not each ton (generally good for small values).\n5. &quot;Percent of base hull value&quot;:  This method prices a component as percentage of the base hull value (the hull component designated as &quot;Is Baseline Hull&quot;). This is typical for components such as armor. It is independent of quantity.\n6. &quot;Percent of base hull value per unit&quot;: This method prices a component similar to the above method, but now quantity plays into the calculation.  For example, with a component quantity of 3 and percentage of 5, the net percentage calculated is 15.\n\nFor the base hull (i.e. Is Baseline Hull), be certain to include any factors that affect the baseline cost as part of the hull.  For example, a streamlined hull cost 10 percent more.  Enter a value of &quot;0.11&quot; MCr/ton if hulls cost 0.1 MCr per ton, generally.\n\nOne thing to note is that Vehicle component costs are _not_ included in ship price - per community recommendation.\n\n## Optional Battle Sheet\nFor Twodsix v5.8+, the system now includes a secondary sheet for ships called the &quot;Battle Sheet&quot;.  It is meant to be a non-tabbed display of critical ship information that is relevant to ship combat.  This sheet could also be used as an alternative display for NPC ships.  Note that the data does not change for the ship actor - just the format of display.  One can go back and forth between the sheet display styles without issue.  One important difference is that the Battle Sheet does not display auto calculated values. The values for power, jump, thrust, and displacement can be changed irrespective on the auto calculate setting.  If you return to the normal ship view, these values should auto calculate correctly. Here is an example view:\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;848&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10 33 55 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b9685f-5373-461f-8b2d-be3d55f023ae&quot;&gt;\n\n\n### How to Access the Battle Sheet\nTo view the battle sheet, click on the gear icon of the sheet header.  \n\n&lt;img width=&quot;72&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10 07 34 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b998b208-6aed-427b-ac39-b14596febc49&quot;&gt;\n\nA pop-up menu should open.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;401&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10 10 13 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64533b8e-02cf-428f-9aea-c2d8c3c70139&quot;&gt;\n\nSelect the &quot;Battle Sheet&quot; for the &quot;This Sheet&quot; option.\n\n### Using the Battle Sheet\nThe battle sheet should have similar functionality to the main ship sheet for the interactive features it displays.  For example, it is possible to edit and delete components listed using the pencil and trashcan icons.  To use a ship position, first select the actor and action from the pulldown menus; next click the position name.  The position action selected should work as for the default sheet.  To edit the position information (e.g. add an actor or add a new action), click on the wrench (spanner) icon.  The position configuration screen should open.  Also note that the order of the positions is sorted by the &quot;Order&quot; value for the position and is not drag/dropable to a new position (unlike cargo and components lists).\n\n### Formatting the Battle Sheet\nThe battle sheet has a few display options to customize its display:\n* Color - Under the display settings -&gt; general, there is an option to change the battle sheet&#39;s color (only when using Twodsix&#39;s default (dark) style).  This setting is independent of the other color settings but the initial value is the same as the default color setting.  Please note that it is not possible to change the scrollbar color at this time.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;670&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10 19 17 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9122eb4-2ad0-4d65-98c4-0a4597394de8&quot;&gt;\n\n* Components to Display in Damage Window - The component list for the damage section may be filtered to exclude certain component subtypes. The setting is under Display Settings -&gt; Ship. For example, here is the setting for excluding accommodations and vehicles.  \n\n&lt;img width=&quot;674&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10 27 54 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac5a72f-fce1-4fa5-b3a9-8fd6057dc25e&quot;&gt;\n\nThe cargo subtype is _always_ excluded.\n\n* Battle Position - Some systems use battle position in combat as opposed to range and/or initiative.  Optionally, a free-form field can be displayed to track this position in the Operations section.  The setting option can be found under Display Options -&gt; Ship.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;674&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10 32 03 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29556620-c9f3-4ff3-be38-edad8b9a2388&quot;&gt;\n\n",
        "markdown": "## Creating and using the Ship sheet\nIn the ‘Actors directory’ of the FoundryVTT UI click on the Create Actor tab. This will open up a new window with options of Name: Type: and Folder: \n\nName and Folder are user options and can be as you wish. The Type option gives a drop down of either Character or Ship; you need to choose ship. This will create a new actor in your selected folder.\n\nLeft clicking on the name of the new ship will open up the ship sheet\n\nTop left hand corner of the sheet show the ship’s image. This can be changed by clicking on the image or via various modules such as Art Galley, just as you would for an actor’s Character sheet.  The image is not usable with Tokenizer.\n\nTo the right of the image is the name as selected when the sheet was created. This can be edited from the sheet.\n\nAlso to the right of the image there are a number of data fields \n* Displacement - The hull size (displacement) defined during the build process.  It represents the maximum mass the ship can carry.\n* TL - the technical level for the ship\n* Jump - the jump drive rating for the ship (in parsecs / hexes)\n* Thrust - the thrust rating for the m-drive in G\n* Fuel - current and maximum fuel available.  Currently, this field is a manually updated.  The bar can be clicked to toggle the label between \"Refined\" and \"Unrefined\".\n* Overdrive - a checkbox to indicate ship is in overdrive\n* Ship Hull - current and max hull points designated during the build process, according to which rule set you have opted for\n* Armor - type of armor installed (description) and the current and max armor points\n* Power management or Power and Weight Management section that contains further data on ship components\n\n### Power management\n  * Power Used and Max generated (based on all installed and operating power components)\n  * Systems - all systems power usage other than dives, sensors and weapons components\n  * M-Drive - sum of power draw for all drive components with \"m-Drive\" or \"m drive\" in name\n  * J-Drive - sum of power draw for all drive components with \"j-Drive\" or \"j drive\" in name\n  * Sensors - all sensor components power usage\n  * Weapons - all weapons components power usage\n\n_Note that power is only included for those components that have an on or damaged status.  Also, power draw / generated is assumed to be per unit.  So the calculation of the total power used by a component is the quantity * power draw/generated_\n\n### Power and Weight Management\n  * Power Used and Max generated (based on all installed and operating components (consumed show as used and generated show as max)\n  * Systems - total weight for all systems that are not cargo, fuel, or vehicle components\n  * Cargo - the total weight for all cargo components\n  * Fuel - the total weight for all fuel components\n  * Vehicles - the total weight for all vehicle components\n  * Avail. (Available) - weight (mass) available to be carried by the ship.  It is equal to the displacement minus the total mass of components.\n\n\nBelow these you will find a tab bar showing:\n* Crew\n* Components\n* Locker\n* Cargo\n* Finances\n* Notes\n\n## Tabs\n**Positions:** This allows the creation of ship’s stations predominantly, but not limited to, use during ship to ship combat\n\n**Crew:** Shows the crew roster\n\n**Components:** The different component parts of the ship as described in the build process\n\n**Locker:** The ship locker and allow the cataloging of equipment stored in the Ship’s Locker \n\n**Cargo** The manifest of cargo components and notes for tracking cargo\n\n**Finance:** A basic text field to allow the tracking of funds.  At the top are the ship hull's basic costs: purchase value, 40-year mortgage value, and monthly maintenance costs.  If auto calc is enabled, these values are calculated based on the component data.  Otherwise the fields are manual entry.\n\n**Notes:** This is a simple text box to allow the GM or player to add reference notes about the given ship\n\nThe ship sheet is under review and development and many of these current sections or for tracking purposes only with manual input. The **Positions** tab does enable some automation as described below\n\n## Positions Tab\nClicking on the Positions tab will show a box allowing the creation of a bespoke position/station for the ship’s crew\n\nClick on the +  sign (Add Ship Position) and a new new position will be created\n\nClicking on the spanner icon will open a new window:\n\n**Position Name:** As it says on the tin, type in chosen name for the position eg Sensor Op, Captain, etc Order: A simple numeric value to show the order of the positions shown on the ship sheet, ie. 1 will be top left , 2 will be top center, 3 top right \n\n**Travellers:** This section is where crew members can be assigned. Travellers and robots are valid actor types.  If you are the GM or a player with permission to create new tokens, you can drag and drop the Character from the sidebar tab. Players without this permission may attach an actor by selecting the plus button.  A pop-up opens for the play to select _one_ of their owned actors to attach to the position.\n\n**Actions:** click on the + and it will add a new action. \n* **Order** is a numeric value again showing position\n* **Name**  (New Action by default) name the action e.g. Electronic Warfare, Command and Control, Fire Beam Laser\n* **Macro/Skill** This is what is given to the action type\n  * For \"Chat\" it is simply what should be outputted in the chat when executing the action.  You can also specify a roll formula by starting the chat string with '/r' or '/R'. The action will make a chat roll as the normal chat box when the roll formula is valid. Note that two contexts (for roll data) are available. The `@` prefix will generally access any selected actor roll data (e.g. `@skills.Tactics`).  To access the ship roll data, prefix the element using `@ship`, (e.g. `@ship.combatPosition`).\n  * For \"Skill Roll\" The skill name has to be provided. Optionally one can also override the default characteristic for that skill or override the difficulty. The skill name will need to be as typed on the character sheet with the same capital, space etc  e.g. `Electronics (Sensors)`. If you want to override the characteristic add `/CHR` after the skill name, for example `Electronics (Sensors)/INT`. To override the difficulty you add it by typing a space and a number followed by a plus, e.g. `Electronics (Sensors) 10+`. You can both override the characteristic and difficulty at the same time as well (`Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+`).  Multiple skills and multiple characteristics can be configured by separating them with the pipe \"|\" character.  The most advantageous skill and/or characteristic for the Actor will be used by the action.  A hull repair action might be configured as `Engineering|Mechanic/INT|EDU 6+`.\n  * For \"Fire Energy Weapons\" you put in a skill (as described above) and select a component to use in the \"Component to use\" dropdown to the right. Currently, this feature is quite limited and will make a skill roll and output as a chat message that you hit with the component that was given. The format is the same as a skill roll, e.g. `Electronics (Sensors)/DEX 6+` (the characteristic and difficulty is optional). Note that the old style of specifying a component (by appending an \"=COMPONENT_ID\") still works.\n  * For \"Execute Macro\", you enter the name of the macro you want to execute.  The following documents are passed as context to the macro to make creating the macro easier.  `actor` is the selected actor document for the position.  `ship` is the ship document. `component` is the selected component.\n* **Component to use** drop down list of the non-cargo components to use for Fire Energy Weapons or Skill Roll.\n* **Action Type** drop down list for the action types described above (Chat, Skill Roll, Fire Energy Weapon, or Execute Macro).\n\nThis process will need to be done for each position. Each position can have single or multiple action and is totally bespoke \n\nOnce positions are created the Character can be dragged to the new position. This will link all actions to the individual character and utilise their skills for the action. \n\nA position can have more than one Character but a Character can only be at one given position at a time. To remove the Character from the position either drag him/her to another position or to remove totally drag to a neutral area of the ship sheet (do not drag over to the screen/canvas as this will place the token there)\n\n## Component Data\nThe component data is used to auto calculate ship weight, power and cost information (if the option is enabled).  To make such calculations work correctly, one needs to understand some important concepts. Key to all these calculations is the hull displacement value (ship size).  Several calculations need this value to work correctly, so it is important to enter a displacement value in the upper right corner of the main sheet.\n\n### Component Weight\nWeight is assumed to be per unit.  So the calculation of the total power used by a component is the quantity * unit weight.  For armament and fuel, the calculation uses available quantity and not total quantity. However, unit weight may also be expressed as a percentage of the ship displacement weight (e.g. armor).  To calculate using percentage, enter the percentage form (e.g. 10 for 10%) and check the box \"Weight is Percentage?\".  For example, this calculation method is the typical method for components such as drives.  For systems such as Cepheus Deluxe, the percentage value to enter can be a bit tricky as there is both a base percentage and a scaling factor due to TL.  For example, a TL 11, m-drive rated at 2G has a base weight of 1.5% of the hull displacement and an associated scaling factor of 1.1.  The % displacement weight value to enter on the component sheet is 1.65 (1.5*1.1).\n\nFor hull components, there is a special designation possible: \"Is Baseline Hull?\" (a checkbox).  If this box checked, the calculations assume that the component designates the displacement of the hull and the weight is not included as part of the carrying capacity (as it defines the maximum carrying capacity).  If autocalc is enabled and there is no valid displacement value entered, the sheet will fill in a displacement value based on a hull component that is the baseline hull.\n\n### Component Power\nA component may either consume power or generate it.  The default is that a component consumes power unless it is a power component (then it assumes it generates power).  The \"Generates Power?\" checkbox may be changed to override these defaults.  For the single-line components listing, power generating components are listed with a \"+\" before their power values.\n\n### Component Price\nThere are four different ways to calculate a component price:\n1. \"MCr per unit\": This method prices a component as the price value entered times the total quantity.\n2. \"MCr per component ton\": This method prices a component as the price value entered times the component's weight. Note that this weight may be dependent on the hull displacement, so it is important to enter a valid displacement value.\n3. \"MCr per hull ton\": This method prices a component as the price value entered times the hull's displacement weight.  Again, a valid displacement value is necessary.\n4. \"MCr per 100 hull ton\": Similar to the above method, for each 100 tons and not each ton (generally good for small values).\n5. \"Percent of base hull value\":  This method prices a component as percentage of the base hull value (the hull component designated as \"Is Baseline Hull\"). This is typical for components such as armor. It is independent of quantity.\n6. \"Percent of base hull value per unit\": This method prices a component similar to the above method, but now quantity plays into the calculation.  For example, with a component quantity of 3 and percentage of 5, the net percentage calculated is 15.\n\nFor the base hull (i.e. Is Baseline Hull), be certain to include any factors that affect the baseline cost as part of the hull.  For example, a streamlined hull cost 10 percent more.  Enter a value of \"0.11\" MCr/ton if hulls cost 0.1 MCr per ton, generally.\n\nOne thing to note is that Vehicle component costs are _not_ included in ship price - per community recommendation.\n\n## Optional Battle Sheet\nFor Twodsix v5.8+, the system now includes a secondary sheet for ships called the \"Battle Sheet\".  It is meant to be a non-tabbed display of critical ship information that is relevant to ship combat.  This sheet could also be used as an alternative display for NPC ships.  Note that the data does not change for the ship actor - just the format of display.  One can go back and forth between the sheet display styles without issue.  One important difference is that the Battle Sheet does not display auto calculated values.

For example, abilities that scale with use are not supported.\n\n# Additional Rules Setting\nSome rulesets require a skill roll to successfully use the psionic ability.  _Cepheus Engine_ is an example of a system where a skill roll is required to use psionic abilities.

Both armor and weapons must be configured to take advantage of this secondary armor feature.\n\n## Weapons\nFirst, make certain that the damage type field is visible on weapon sheets with this Item Setting:\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;575&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 9 01 23 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/228562832-98327f03-ab22-4f9c-8319-e5493efaf129.png&quot;&gt;\n\nNext, check that the list of damage types covers the rules you are using under Ruleset Settings\nThe values for this setting should be _comma separated_.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;577&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 18 07 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230200190-3999af78-1ebc-4d97-8727-228be44dee7f.png&quot;&gt;\n\nThe default list is: &quot;Ballistic, Bludgeoning, Corrosive, EMP, Energy, Fire, Laser, Piercing, Poison, Plasma, Psionic, Rad, Slashing, Smoke, Stun&quot;. The types can be multiple words, such as &quot;Death Ray&quot;.  If you make this field a blank and then reload the world, it will reset to the default list.\n\nThen, select a damage type in the damage type field for the weapon, e.g.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;528&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 20 43 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230201031-2976c903-d46a-4ac5-afa4-8ae01062136e.png&quot;&gt;\n\nOnly one damage type may be used for weapons. Optionally, you can select a damage type for the active consumable (the magazine).  If the consumable and weapon both have damage types, the consumable&#39;s damage type is used. Otherwise the weapon&#39;s damage type is used.  If both are left blank, the calculations ignore damage type.\n\n## Armor\nSecondary protection value is only included when the damage type matches one of the protection types for the armor.  To set protection types for armor, use the multi-select field for the armor.  Note that an armor may have more than one type of secondary protection (use cmd/cntl to select more than one option).  For example below, the armor provides secondary protection for both fire and laser damage types.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;520&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 26 25 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230202768-8aba6303-58a7-4cc6-8b00-b3c917b8a92d.png&quot;&gt;\n\n\n## Applied Damage\nWhen dropping / applying damage to an actor, the net damage applied will consider the secondary armor values.  If there is a match between the weapon&#39;s damage type and _one_ of the secondary protection types, the secondary armor value is added to the effective armor.  In the below example, the weapon causes fire damage and the armor worn by the target has secondary protection of both fire and laser.  Thus, the secondary protection value (2 in the image) is added to the effective armor value further reducing the damage applied. In this case, the total armor value is greater than the damage, so the actor takes no damage from the attack.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;401&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 9 16 05 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/228567311-46220f35-5523-454c-b859-8824074c7d72.png&quot;&gt;\n\n# Display of Primary and Secondary Armor on Actor Sheets\n## Options for Traveller Sheet\nThere are multiple ways to display the primary and secondary armor values on the Traveller actor sheet. This setting under Advanced Settings -&gt; Damage determines whether these armor values are the sum of all layers work or the maximum value across the layers.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;654&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 11 49 05 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/84bc836d-2d4e-4e33-9ace-37b1e428968f&quot;&gt;\n\nThe default display of armor values is the primary armor and the _incremental_ secondary armor value.  It might look like \n\n&lt;img width=&quot;188&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 11 54 21 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/e66e451a-31d0-461a-8f77-2b842f641ece&quot;&gt;\n\nwhere the primary armor value is &quot;6&quot; (all damage is reduced by six) and the secondary armor reduces damage by an additional two if the damage type is corrosive (as shown in the tooltip). So if the damage is corrosive, the total reduction would be eight.  The &quot;plus&quot; sign indicates that the secondary damage is _additive_ to the primary value.  Some have found this display confusing, so there is a display option to show the primary and total armor value instead.  This display options is under Display Settings -&gt; Actor.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;655&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 11 59 27 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/a97f6d11-ef00-4183-888d-e700815d07f8&quot;&gt;\n\nIt results in the following display for the same actor as previously, but note that the second number followed by the &#39;/&#39; is the potential total value and not the incremental value for secondary armor. Also, this display mode is disabled when using armor that protects a fraction of the damage (armor values less than one).\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;173&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12 00 49 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/3bd0d0ab-f980-419a-88fc-31dd4d90afbb&quot;&gt;\n\n## Notes\n* When wearing multiple layers, it is possible that the total might be higher than is possible to actually encounter during combat.

Both armor and weapons must be configured to take advantage of this secondary armor feature.\n\n## Weapons\nFirst, make certain that the damage type field is visible on weapon sheets with this Item Setting:\n\n<img width=\"575\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 9 01 23 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/228562832-98327f03-ab22-4f9c-8319-e5493efaf129.png\">\n\nNext, check that the list of damage types covers the rules you are using under Ruleset Settings\nThe values for this setting should be _comma separated_.\n\n<img width=\"577\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 18 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230200190-3999af78-1ebc-4d97-8727-228be44dee7f.png\">\n\nThe default list is: \"Ballistic, Bludgeoning, Corrosive, EMP, Energy, Fire, Laser, Piercing, Poison, Plasma, Psionic, Rad, Slashing, Smoke, Stun\". The types can be multiple words, such as \"Death Ray\".  If you make this field a blank and then reload the world, it will reset to the default list.\n\nThen, select a damage type in the damage type field for the weapon, e.g.\n\n<img width=\"528\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 20 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230201031-2976c903-d46a-4ac5-afa4-8ae01062136e.png\">\n\nOnly one damage type may be used for weapons. Optionally, you can select a damage type for the active consumable (the magazine).  If the consumable and weapon both have damage types, the consumable's damage type is used. Otherwise the weapon's damage type is used.  If both are left blank, the calculations ignore damage type.\n\n## Armor\nSecondary protection value is only included when the damage type matches one of the protection types for the armor.  To set protection types for armor, use the multi-select field for the armor.  Note that an armor may have more than one type of secondary protection (use cmd/cntl to select more than one option).  For example below, the armor provides secondary protection for both fire and laser damage types.\n\n<img width=\"520\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 3 26 25 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/230202768-8aba6303-58a7-4cc6-8b00-b3c917b8a92d.png\">\n\n\n## Applied Damage\nWhen dropping / applying damage to an actor, the net damage applied will consider the secondary armor values.  If there is a match between the weapon's damage type and _one_ of the secondary protection types, the secondary armor value is added to the effective armor.  In the below example, the weapon causes fire damage and the armor worn by the target has secondary protection of both fire and laser.  Thus, the secondary protection value (2 in the image) is added to the effective armor value further reducing the damage applied. In this case, the total armor value is greater than the damage, so the actor takes no damage from the attack.\n\n<img width=\"401\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 9 16 05 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/228567311-46220f35-5523-454c-b859-8824074c7d72.png\">\n\n# Display of Primary and Secondary Armor on Actor Sheets\n## Options for Traveller Sheet\nThere are multiple ways to display the primary and secondary armor values on the Traveller actor sheet. This setting under Advanced Settings -> Damage determines whether these armor values are the sum of all layers work or the maximum value across the layers.\n\n<img width=\"654\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 11 49 05 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/84bc836d-2d4e-4e33-9ace-37b1e428968f\">\n\nThe default display of armor values is the primary armor and the _incremental_ secondary armor value.  It might look like \n\n<img width=\"188\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 11 54 21 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/e66e451a-31d0-461a-8f77-2b842f641ece\">\n\nwhere the primary armor value is \"6\" (all damage is reduced by six) and the secondary armor reduces damage by an additional two if the damage type is corrosive (as shown in the tooltip). So if the damage is corrosive, the total reduction would be eight.  The \"plus\" sign indicates that the secondary damage is _additive_ to the primary value.  Some have found this display confusing, so there is a display option to show the primary and total armor value instead.  This display options is under Display Settings -> Actor.\n\n<img width=\"655\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 11 59 27 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/a97f6d11-ef00-4183-888d-e700815d07f8\">\n\nIt results in the following display for the same actor as previously, but note that the second number followed by the '/' is the potential total value and not the incremental value for secondary armor. Also, this display mode is disabled when using armor that protects a fraction of the damage (armor values less than one).\n\n<img width=\"173\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12 00 49 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/3bd0d0ab-f980-419a-88fc-31dd4d90afbb\">\n\n## Notes\n* When wearing multiple layers, it is possible that the total might be higher than is possible to actually encounter during combat.  Note that the damage calculations are calculated for a specific damage type and should follow the rules.  _The display on the actor sheet can't show all the potential possibilities where multiple layers are worn and thus should be seen as indicative only._\n\n* Since Robot and Animal sheets use a direct input of the primary and secondary armor values (not calculated from the armor worn), these armor values are always shown as incremental (using the plus).\n"

Please note that it _does not_ apply the damage to the ship but merely lists the hits to the various systems. The damage rules implementation are for ships and not vessels.  \n\nLegacy ships and components will not work right away without some changes/edits.  You will have to adjust some rules settings, change armament information, and possibly change armor information to fully use this new feature with existing ships and components.  Also, damage rolls made prior to this version will not work as they don&#39;t contain all the extra data needed.  \n\n# Example Damage Report\nWhen dropping a damage roll card onto a ship (or its token) a damage report is set to chat listing the hits to each ship component and the crew.  An example report looks like,\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;296&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-24 at 1 24 41 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dedbea4-ba4e-4042-9229-3e6a1b1beea4&quot; /&gt;\n\n# Ruleset Settings\nFor this feature, two new settings (under Advanced Settings -&gt; Ship) have been added so that users can customize to something compatible with their own system.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;657&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 3 10 13 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cc5c0d7-cc89-494f-8fda-b6ae9153323a&quot; /&gt;\n\n## Ship Weapon Type Setting\nThe first new setting defines the allowed weapon types for armaments.  The options are CE, CD, or CT.  This setting selects the valid list of weapons types that can be selected.  \n### CE (Cepheus Engine)\nThe CE option follows the Cepheus Engine rules.  The valid options look like \n\n&lt;img width=&quot;146&quot; height=&quot;259&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-24 at 12 15 59 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b3ed2d-424e-40ca-babd-e5ce01c9f072&quot; /&gt;\n\n### CD (Cepheus Deluxe)\nThe CD options is compatible with Cepheus Deluxe, Cepheus Deluxe Extended Edition, and Cepheus Light.  The valid options are:\n \n&lt;img width=&quot;158&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-24 at 12 18 34 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00977fa0-79ee-464e-b4ff-006d735ad24b&quot; /&gt;\n\nNote that missiles for CD have been listed separately even though the penetration matrix does not list them separately.  The system converts them to either light or intermediate, as appropriate.  \n\n### CT (Classic Traveller)\nThe CT (Classic Traveller) weapons options are,\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;128&quot; height=&quot;123&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-24 at 12 22 56 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d32514bc-e3e9-4693-9d72-52aba76bf310&quot; /&gt;\n\n### Alpha Cephei\nThe AC options are,\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;185&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 3 12 38 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9433a94a-3cae-44ec-838f-84941deb193a&quot; /&gt;\n\n### Selecting a Weapon Type on the Armament Sheet\nAfter making this selection, all armament ship components will now need to select an option from a new Weapon Type field on the armament sheet. For example,\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;542&quot; height=&quot;623&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-24 at 12 26 29 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41deab62-cb21-4691-83b0-b01f44ca1148&quot; /&gt;\n\n_Any pre-existing armaments (either as items or on ships) will need to have this field updated as there is no migration possible._\n\n## Rules for handling ship damage\nThere are several options for how damage is calculated to ships for this setting\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 3 13 31 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/779b4b36-160a-442f-8107-af91d40312aa&quot; /&gt;\n\n* Components damaged - this option implements rules per Cepheus Engine.  The damage roll is converted to a number of single, double and triple hits to various ship components.  Armor reduces the damage.\n* Hull damage with critical - this setting implements damage mostly to the hull (after subtracting armor).  For critical attacks (effect &gt;= 6), or when hull damage would cross below a major threshold (e.g. 90%, 80%, 70%...) a critical hit is generated.  Users playing MgT2e might find this setting more compatible.\n* Hull only - only the hull of the ship is damaged (subtracting the current armor value first)\n* Surface or Internal - This method implements the method used by several Stellagama Publishing products (e.g. Cepheus Deluxe, Cepheus Light, etc.).  A successful attack is referenced to a penetration matrix and the type of hit is selected (i.e. surface, internal, critical, destroyed).  After the hit type is selected, the location randomly selected. For this option, the armor label used for the ship becomes very important.  Somewhere in the armor label, you must list the armor type, either _unarmored_, _light_, _heavy_, or _massive_ (if Twodsix has localized terms for these armor types, use those instead).  The system does not adjust armor type based on ship size (displacement) so the value used should be the effective one.\n* Classic Traveller - hits are processed through single lookup table (Hit Locations).  No rules for radiation damage.\n* Alpha Cephei - This option implements the AC rules for ship damage by looking up individual hits on a location table.  Armor gates damage rather than reducing it. Note that Crew critical hits are displayed as having the maximum number of hits for a component.\n* Cepheus Universal - This damage mechanism translates damage to a number of hull and component hits.  There are no defined rules for radiation hits.  Screen mechanics haven&#39;t been implemented.\n\n### The Increased Importance of the Armor and Hull Fields on the Ship Sheet\nFor this new feature, it is important to use the armor and hull fields on the ship sheet in specific ways. \n\n&lt;img width=&quot;207&quot; height=&quot;141&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-09-24 at 1 14 40 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c2d02f-1c36-4cb0-a0c2-b73f48c06fe5&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe hull values (current - top and, maximum - bottom) become important for using the Hull Damage with Critical as critical are added for each damage threshold (i.e. each 10%). So manually updating the current hull value is necessary between applying attacks.  Also, The armor description filed is important when using Surface or Internal ship damage rules.  The description box must contain one of the armor descriptors (either _unarmored_, _light_, _heavy_, or _massive_). Finally the armor current value will reduce incoming damage by that amount (e.g. a current hull value of 5 will reduce the incoming damage by 5 hits).  Any damage to the armor will need updated between attacks.\n\n# Limitations\n* There isn&#39;t yet a way to have Meson weapons bypass/reduce armor with the &quot;Surface or Internal&quot; damage rules.\n* It isn&#39;t feasible to make a migration for existing armament components so that weapon type is correct.  So, each existing armament will need to be adjusted by the ship owner/GM to make this new feature work.\n* Ship damage listed is not automatically applied to the ship.\n* Systems might be damaged multiple times.  These aren&#39;t combined into a consolidated list to account for cases where there may be duplicate or redundant systems and/or where the sequence of the damage is important.\n* Note that location rolls are not shown on the chat log, just the results.  Also, the internal javascript random generator is used rather than Foundry&#39;s to speed up the code and not swamp the chat log.\n* Shields are not implemented for Surface or Internal damage rules or Screens for CU.\n* Damage resistances or offsets for very large vessels not implemented.",

These categories (or &quot;Groups&quot;) have no function other than change how skills are displayed on the Traveller sheet (e.g. groups can&#39;t be used as a skill or roll modifier).  _Skill Groups don&#39;t affect NPC, Animal or Robot Sheets_.  Here is a simple example.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;490&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-01-08 at 8 37 55 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/0cd81aff-03c2-4575-ac78-64c0f2212357&quot;&gt;\n\n\nIn the above image, skills are organized into two, user defined categories: Social and Technical.  The default categories (designated by the system) are used for when there is no skill group specified or when the skill is the special (i.e. Untrained skill). The JOAT skill is not given a category.\n\n# How to use\n1. Enable skill grouping in settings. Under Twodsix Settings -&gt; Display Settings -&gt; Actor there is a new setting to organize skills by group: \n&lt;img width=&quot;651&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-01-06 at 10 01 57 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/2ae2cfc2-5bfc-400b-a39e-8256e49c535a&quot;&gt;\n\nIt is off by default.\n\n2. Enter a label for each skill on the Traveller sheet.  There is a new field on each skill description call &quot;Group Label&quot;.  This field is a freeform string field where the user can enter any group label they want.  The system will automatically group by labels that match _exactly_.  Int the example below, the group label is &quot;Technical&quot;.  Note that there are no predefined labels.  Each traveller may have their own unique grouping.  If no label is entered, the skill is placed in the &quot;No Group&quot; group.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;550&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-01-06 at 10 05 49 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/cd6951c6-a0e7-4811-bf5d-600291d68d9c&quot;&gt;\n\n3. Skills may be drag and dropped within a group (if that setting is used) but no between groups.  To move a skill between groups the &quot;Group Label&quot; on the skill must be changed.\n4.

These categories (or \"Groups\") have no function other than change how skills are displayed on the Traveller sheet (e.g. groups can't be used as a skill or roll modifier).  _Skill Groups don't affect NPC, Animal or Robot Sheets_.  Here is a simple example.\n\n<img width=\"490\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-08 at 8 37 55 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/0cd81aff-03c2-4575-ac78-64c0f2212357\">\n\n\nIn the above image, skills are organized into two, user defined categories: Social and Technical.  The default categories (designated by the system) are used for when there is no skill group specified or when the skill is the special (i.e. Untrained skill). The JOAT skill is not given a category.\n\n# How to use\n1. Enable skill grouping in settings. Under Twodsix Settings -> Display Settings -> Actor there is a new setting to organize skills by group: \n<img width=\"651\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-06 at 10 01 57 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/2ae2cfc2-5bfc-400b-a39e-8256e49c535a\">\n\nIt is off by default.\n\n2. Enter a label for each skill on the Traveller sheet.  There is a new field on each skill description call \"Group Label\".  This field is a freeform string field where the user can enter any group label they want.  The system will automatically group by labels that match _exactly_.  Int the example below, the group label is \"Technical\".  Note that there are no predefined labels.  Each traveller may have their own unique grouping.  If no label is entered, the skill is placed in the \"No Group\" group.\n\n<img width=\"550\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-06 at 10 05 49 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/cd6951c6-a0e7-4811-bf5d-600291d68d9c\">\n\n3. Skills may be drag and dropped within a group (if that setting is used) but no between groups.  To move a skill between groups the \"Group Label\" on the skill must be changed.\n4. Skill groups may be hidden/revealed by toggling the 'eye' icon."

(It is for https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/207738/Skills-List-2e which is an Open Gaming License Pay What You Want supplement for for Cepheus Engine - which is pretty much the Open Gaming License version of MGT1 - that provides a skill list that is very similar to the one in MGT2.)\n\n## Classic Traveller\nWith Twodsix v4.22 and beyond, basic support has been added for Classic Traveller (CT) as defined by _The Traveller Book_ (copy-write Far Future Enterprises-FFE). FFE, through Mongoose, have permitted Twodsix to implement rules for CT. Currently, most of the core functionality for personal combat and actor sheets have been added. The ship sheets have not been updated.  To use the default configuration, select &#39;Classic Traveller&#39; from the rulesets.\n\nA few things to note:\n* CT does not use characteristic modifiers.  So those appear as zeroes on the actor sheets.\n* To use the DM for weapons based on characteristics of strength or dexterity (&quot;Weapons and Equipment&quot; table, _The Traveller Book_, pg. 44) - these features should be added to the handling modifiers for the weapon - https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Weapons-Handling-Feature\n* Armor does not reduce damage in CT.  Rather, DM are added based on the weapon used and the target&#39;s armor.  These modifiers, as defined in the _The Traveller Book_ (pg. 46) have been automated in the calculations.  However, one must specify the weapon type (range band) and armor type for the target.  As before, a target must be selected on the canvas.\n* Only Reflect armor may be layered - when layering, the system selects the lowest (best) DM of the two armors for the weapon type.\n* Encumbrance and item weight is in gm and not kg.  Please note this when entering item weights.\n* There is no initiative in CT, per se, as all combat actions occur simultaneously. Nonetheless an initiative formula has been added to the default settings if one wants to home-brew combat order.\n* Automatic fire follows the format of CT - e.g. single fire/auto.  So for most automatic weapons, that would be &#39;1/4&#39;.  A submachine gun would be &#39;0/4&#39; if you don&#39;t allow it to use single fire mode.  If the automatic rifle is used in single shot mode, DM&#39;s for a rifle are used instead (per RAW).  If the submachine gun is used in single fire mode, DM&#39;s for an auto pistol are used instead (home-brew). _The system does not implement the Group Hits by Automatic Fire or Shotguns_. GM&#39;s will need to implement those features by hand.\n* Armor has a &#39;DM&#39; listed after the armor name on the actor sheets.  This DM is _added_ to the default weapon-armor modifier.  It is typical for animals that have modified armor type.  For example, using an automatic pistol against cloth armor with a DM of -2 would have a net weapon-armor DM of -5 (-3 base and -2 for the additional modifier).\n* Jack-of-All-Trades (JOAT) works a bit differently for CT than other rulesets.  For the RAW, the value is binary.  Meaning that a JOAT of one (or more), the untrained skill value is zero.  If JOAT is zero, the untrained skill is -3 (the system default).  The RAW have that player characters have default zero-level skills for all weapon types (that need to be added to the character sheet).\n* As of version 4.24.0, it is now possible to add custom range and armor modifiers to weapons.  See, https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Custom-CT-Modifiers\n\nRight now, there is just an items compendium consisting of skills, weapons and armor for CT, although we may expand in the future.  All descriptions are from the Cepheus Item SRD and not _The Classic Traveller Book_ (per use terms).  As a starting point, the CE compendium would be a good start to add other items.\n\n\n## Cepheus Universal\nWith version 5.9+ there is now basic support for Cepheus Universal (CU).  There is a rules setting that customizes the advanced settings so there should be no other changes needed.  A few things to note about the implementation and the compromises to fit it within the broader Twodsix setting:\n* Rate-of-fire / Auto X is used to specify an automatic weapon.  A single integer of 4, 10, or 20 is valid per rules.  The input is not constrained to these values and will default to single fire.\n* Weapon recoil is handled using the &quot;weapons handling&quot; feature ([Weapons Handling](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Weapons-Handling-Feature)).  The CU compendium shows examples of how to configure this setting to work per the CU recoil rules.  Recoil for auto fire is adjusted per the rules.\n* Armor protection works very differently with CU.  Armor protects against specific damage types.  So all armor and weapons must define the type of damage they block or cause.  Also, there is no primary or secondary armor values - just a single armor value.  For those wanting to make changes to the armor value using Active Effects, the field used is `system.secondaryArmor.value`.\n* Rolling for parry of an attack is handled automatically.  However, certain conditions must be met.  The attack must cause melee damage. The system looks for the &quot;Melee Combat&quot; skill (or its localized equivalent) for the parry attempt.  For most weapons, the attack must be within personal or close range.  An item may parry longer ranged melee attacks (e.g. a bow and arrow) if the item has the &quot;Acts as shield&quot; characteristic checked (e.g. the weapon is a shield).\nExample of damage that can be parried (note arrow symbol)\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;288&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 8 18 20 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c5a1d6-b491-4bbc-8fd8-8e502ff908a8&quot;&gt;\n\nExample of damage that can be shielded (note shield symbol):\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;283&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 8 19 00 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8646b85-f821-4d26-a5c7-4d7dc998f61b&quot;&gt;\n\n* Characteristic rolls are meant to be 6+ in difficulty.  Twodsix still uses 8+ but applies a +2 DM to compensate.\n* Group initiative is not programmed at this time.\n* The compendium for CU is rather limited at this time (i.e. skills, combat weapons and armor).  Happy for the community to contribute further to the compendium for other items.\n* Variable shotgun damage with range is not implemented.",

Note that this setting also overrides how damage is implemented - applying it to LFB and STA rather than the standard characteristics.\n\nSupport for Traits was added to the system with version 0.8.14\n\nBasic support for new Lifeblood and Stamina characteristics added in version 0.8.26.  Lifeblood and Stamina are supported along with wounded status (if enabled by option).\n\nCompendiums for Cepheus Deluxe excluding ship, vehicle, and robot information are included with the system.\n\n\n## Cepheus Light\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Light (which should also work fairly well for related systems like Sword of Cepheus if you don't mind the SF theming) select 'Cepheus Light' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Select the setting to handle difficulties by changing the target number rather than adding/subtracting modifiers.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Tactics skill yourself after rolling , or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros)\n* Select CEL style autofire rules\n* Sets a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Use the skills, items, etc from the various 'ce light-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers.\n\n## Cepheus Light Upgraded\nAs Cepheus Light above, but choose 'Cepheus Light Upgraded' instead.\n\n## Cepheus Faster Than Light\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Faster Than Light select 'Cepheus Faster Than Light' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Select the setting to handle difficulties by changing the target number rather than adding/subtracting modifiers.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Tactics skill yourself after rolling, or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros)\n* Sets a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Use the skills, items, etc from the various 'ce ftl-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers (this is already done in the above compendiums).\n\nReasonably complete compendiums for Cepheus Faster Than Light exist.\n\n## Cepheus Atom\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Atom select 'Cepheus Atom' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Combat skill yourself after rolling ,or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros - though you need to change line 5 of the macro to use the 'Combat' skill rather than the 'Tactics' skill).\n* Set a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n* Turn on \"Show END and 'Lifeblood' (STR) as characteristics\" (which also makes Contamination show)\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Use the skills, items, etc from the various 'cepheus atom-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers (this is already done in the above compendiums).\n* Give every character JOAT-3 on the skills tab.\n* Mutations exist in a compendum as items (augmentations). Any effects on the character will need to be handled manually.\n\nCompendiums containing skills, items, mutations, robots and monsters are included, additionally the various compendiums from Cepheus FTL might be useful.\nThere is also a gm screen compendium suitable for use with the https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gm-screen module.\n\n## Barbaric!\nTo get the system closer to Barbaric! select 'Barbaric!' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Change the initiative formula to just 2d6 (i.e. you need to add the Combat skill yourself after rolling ,or use the 'Update Initiative' macro found here: https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros - though you need to change line 5 of the macro to use the 'Combat' skill rather than the 'Tactics' skill).\n* Set a natural 2/12 to be considered a failure/success regardless of actual Effect.\n* Set \"What effect (if above 0) is required for a throw to be considered a critical success/failure (i.e. be colored green/red).\" to 4. (Actually only relevant for Spellcasting).\n* Turn on \"Show END and 'Lifeblood' (STR) as characteristics\" (which also makes Contamination show)\n* Turn off \"Show Contamination below Lifeblood\"\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers (this is already done in the above compendiums).\n* Give every character JOAT-3 on the skills tab.\n* Races and Traits can be handled like Mutations in Cepheus Atom.\n\nNo compendiums for Barbaric! yet exist, though the ones from Cepheus Atom are somewhat useful, as examples if nothing else.\n\n## Cepheus Quantum\nTo get the system closer to Cepheus Quantum select 'Cepheus Quantum' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings, that will set the following settings:\n\n* Choose the CEL difficulty list.\n* Set skills to not use any characteristic for modifiers.\n* Use the careers, items, etc from the 'cepheus quantum-something' compendiums (supplied by @marvin9257).\n* Change the initiative formula to just 1d1\n* Turn on \"Show END and 'Lifeblood' (STR) as characteristics\"\n* Turn off \"Show Contamination below Lifeblood\"\n\nIn play, handle the differences to Cepheus Engine as follows:\n* Create a character by importing one of the careers from the career compendium and renaming it to your character's name, then changing the attributes.\n* Give every character JOAT-3 on the skills tab.\n* Ignore the initiative that gets rolled, everyone gets the same initiative (optionally, you might want to take a look at the https://foundryvtt.com/packages/Popcorn module if you want some structure to the initiative)\n\nReasonably complete compendiums for Cepheus Quantum exist, additionally the various compendiums from Cepheus FTL might be useful.\nThere is also a gm screen compendium suitable for use with the https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gm-screen module.\n\n## MGT1\nTo get the system closer to MGT1 switch to 'Cepheus Engine' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings.\n\nCompendiums with skills, items, etc cannot be included for licensing reasons, so you have to enter those yourself, but the various Cepheus Engine compendium are sufficiently close that they should be useful, even though they are not for MTG1. (Cepheus Engine is pretty much the Open Gaming License version of MTG1.)\n\n## MGT2\nTo get the system closer to MGT2 change the following in the system settings after switching to 'Other' in the dropdown near the top of the system settings:\n\n* Choose the CE difficulty list.\n* Change the initiative formula to \"2d6 -8  + max(@characteristics.dexterity.mod,@characteristics.intelligence.mod)\"\n* Change the modifier for a characteristic of 0 to -3 rather than -2\n* Switch to handling difficulties by changing the target number rather than adding/subtracting modifiers.\n* Rename 'advantage' to 'boon' and 'disadvantage' to 'bane'\n* Select CEL style autofire rules and make sure weapons have a single number for their 'Rate of Fire/Auto X' setting.\n* Set \"What effect (if above 0) is required for a throw to be considered a critical success/failure (i.e. be colored green/red).\" to 6.\n* Set encumbrance formula to \"2*(@characteristics.endurance.current + @characteristics.strength.current + max(0, @skills.AthleticsEndurance) + max(0, @skills.AthleticsStrength))\". Set the \"Fraction of maximum encumbrance when encumbrance roll modifier applies\" to 0.5\n* Set the \"Animals use hits for damage\" option to true.\n* Set \"Factor to multiply the weight value of a equipped armor.\" to 0.25\n* Set \"Animal Types are Independent of Niche\" to true.\n* Set \"Show degrees of success for non-attack rolls\" to \"Other\"\n\nCompendiums with skills, items, etc. cannot be included for licensing reasons, so you have to enter those yourself, except that the '2e skills' compendium is sufficiently close that it should be useful, even though it is not based on MGT2. (It is for https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/207738/Skills-List-2e which is an Open Gaming License Pay What You Want supplement for for Cepheus Engine - which is pretty much the Open Gaming License version of MGT1 - that provides a skill list that is very similar to the one in MGT2.)\n\n## Classic Traveller\nWith Twodsix v4.22 and beyond, basic support has been added for Classic Traveller (CT) as defined by _The Traveller Book_ (copy-write Far Future Enterprises-FFE). FFE, through Mongoose, have permitted Twodsix to implement rules for CT. Currently, most of the core functionality for personal combat and actor sheets have been added. The ship sheets have not been updated.  To use the default configuration, select 'Classic Traveller' from the rulesets.\n\nA few things to note:\n* CT does not use characteristic modifiers.  So those appear as zeroes on the actor sheets.\n* To use the DM for weapons based on characteristics of strength or dexterity (\"Weapons and Equipment\" table, _The Traveller Book_, pg. 44) - these features should be added to the handling modifiers for the weapon - https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Weapons-Handling-Feature\n* Armor does not reduce damage in CT.  Rather, DM are added based on the weapon used and the target's armor.  These modifiers, as defined in the _The Traveller Book_ (pg. 46) have been automated in the calculations.  However, one must specify the weapon type (range band) and armor type for the target.  As before, a target must be selected on the canvas.\n* Only Reflect armor may be layered - when layering, the system selects the lowest (best) DM of the two armors for the weapon type.\n* Encumbrance and item weight is in gm and not kg.  Please note this when entering item weights.\n* There is no initiative in CT, per se, as all combat actions occur simultaneously. Nonetheless an initiative formula has been added to the default settings if one wants to home-brew combat order.\n* Automatic fire follows the format of CT - e.g. single fire/auto.  So for most automatic weapons, that would be '1/4'.  A submachine gun would be '0/4' if you don't allow it to use single fire mode.  If the automatic rifle is used in single shot mode, DM's for a rifle are used instead (per RAW).  If the submachine gun is used in single fire mode, DM's for an auto pistol are used instead (home-brew). _The system does not implement the Group Hits by Automatic Fire or Shotguns_. GM's will need to implement those features by hand.\n* Armor has a 'DM' listed after the armor name on the actor sheets.  This DM is _added_ to the default weapon-armor modifier.  It is typical for animals that have modified armor type.  For example, using an automatic pistol against cloth armor with a DM of -2 would have a net weapon-armor DM of -5 (-3 base and -2 for the additional modifier).\n* Jack-of-All-Trades (JOAT) works a bit differently for CT than other rulesets.  For the RAW, the value is binary.  Meaning that a JOAT of one (or more), the untrained skill value is zero.  If JOAT is zero, the untrained skill is -3 (the system default).  The RAW have that player characters have default zero-level skills for all weapon types (that need to be added to the character sheet).\n* As of version 4.24.0, it is now possible to add custom range and armor modifiers to weapons.  See, https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Custom-CT-Modifiers\n\nRight now, there is just an items compendium consisting of skills, weapons and armor for CT, although we may expand in the future.  All descriptions are from the Cepheus Item SRD and not _The Classic Traveller Book_ (per use terms).  As a starting point, the CE compendium would be a good start to add other items.\n\n\n## Cepheus Universal\nWith version 5.9+ there is now basic support for Cepheus Universal (CU).  There is a rules setting that customizes the advanced settings so there should be no other changes needed.  A few things to note about the implementation and the compromises to fit it within the broader Twodsix setting:\n* Rate-of-fire / Auto X is used to specify an automatic weapon.  A single integer of 4, 10, or 20 is valid per rules.  The input is not constrained to these values and will default to single fire.\n* Weapon recoil is handled using the \"weapons handling\" feature ([Weapons Handling](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/Weapons-Handling-Feature)).  The CU compendium shows examples of how to configure this setting to work per the CU recoil rules.  Recoil for auto fire is adjusted per the rules.\n* Armor protection works very differently with CU.  Armor protects against specific damage types.  So all armor and weapons must define the type of damage they block or cause.  Also, there is no primary or secondary armor values - just a single armor value.  For those wanting to make changes to the armor value using Active Effects, the field used is `system.secondaryArmor.value`.\n* Rolling for parry of an attack is handled automatically.  However, certain conditions must be met.  The attack must cause melee damage. The system looks for the \"Melee Combat\" skill (or its localized equivalent) for the parry attempt.  For most weapons, the attack must be within personal or close range.  An item may parry longer ranged melee attacks (e.g. a bow and arrow) if the item has the \"Acts as shield\" characteristic checked (e.g. the weapon is a shield).\nExample of damage that can be parried (note arrow symbol)\n\n<img width=\"288\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 8 18 20 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c5a1d6-b491-4bbc-8fd8-8e502ff908a8\">\n\nExample of damage that can be shielded (note shield symbol):\n\n<img width=\"283\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 8 19 00 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8646b85-f821-4d26-a5c7-4d7dc998f61b\">\n\n* Characteristic rolls are meant to be 6+ in difficulty.  Twodsix still uses 8+ but applies a +2 DM to compensate.\n* Group initiative is not programmed at this time.\n* The compendium for CU is rather limited at this time (i.e. skills, combat weapons and armor).  Happy for the community to contribute further to the compendium for other items.\n* Variable shotgun damage with range is not implemented."

The files in these wiki folders will no longer be maintained.  The descriptions are still accurate and useful.\n\n## How to import\n### Import a Macro\n1. Open the macro (a file with the extension .js) in GitHub and select the &quot;raw&quot; option in the upper right of the code window\n1. Copy all the text (control-a or cmd-a then control-c or cmd-c, depending on your operating system)\n1. Click on a blank item in the macro toolbar in FoundryVTT\n1. A &quot;New Macro&quot; window should open - paste the copied text in the &quot;Command&quot; window (cmd-v or control-v)\n1. Select &quot;Script&quot; as the &quot;Type&quot;\n1. Type in a helpful name where it says &quot;New Macro&quot;\n1. (optional) Add an icon by clicking on the dice graphic in the upper left corner\n1. Select &quot;Save Macro&quot; button\n\n### Import a Rollable Table\n1. Open the rollable table file (it will have a format something like &quot;fvtt-RollTable-TableName.json&quot;\n1. Select the &quot;raw&quot; option in the upper right of the code window\n1. Download the file (file save as) from your browser&#39;s menu - this depends on your browser.  Remember the download name and location\n1. After the file is downloaded, go to the FoundryVTT screen, select the Rollable Table Icon and click the &quot;Create Table Button&quot;\n1. Under name type &quot;temp&quot; and select the folder you want.\n1. Close the new popup window\n1. Right click the &quot;temp&quot; table icon on the tables list\n1. Select &quot;Import Data&quot;\n1. Click the browse button and selected the .json file you just downloaded\n1. Click the &quot;Import&quot; button\nThe table will automatically be renamed.  _Note: most of the macros that use a rollable table for data input require an exact table name.  You shouldn&#39;t rename the table unless you know how to make the corresponding change in the macro script._\n\n## Specific Macro Descriptions\nThis section provides a brief description of what the macros do and how to use them.\n\n### Healing Macros\n* **Heal for GM or Player** - This macro lets a character make a medicine check / skill roll to heal a player (first aid).  The player must have a medkit /medical kit.  A successful roll removes player damage per the effect of the roll.  The characteristic order of healing is, &#39;endurance&#39;, &#39;strength&#39;, &#39;dexterity&#39;.  The &quot;multiplier&quot; constant in the macro is used to adjust the healing amount different rules sets (some rules multiply the effect to calculate the healed damage).  The default multiplier is 1.0 (at line 1).  This value can be changed to suit your rules set.  To run the macro as a GM, you must first target a token (the player being healed) on the current scene. Do this by right clicking the token and select the target button (the bullseye). Next, select the healer by left clicking on that player&#39;s token. Run the macro.  To run as the healing player, you just need to target the actor to be healed. _The macro will not work as a player unless you have &quot;owner&quot; permissions on the target._\n* **First Aid** - When the player wants to roll their own Medicine check but does not have permissions to change another character&#39;s health, this macro takes the _last_ medicine check in the chat log and applies the healing effect.  It is run by the GM and the healed character must be targeted (as the similar macro above).\n\n### NPC Parsers\nThese series of macros take the output of various, online character generators and convert that information into a format that is compatible with a twodsix actor.  While the title says NPC, the generated actor could also be used for a player.  The macros do their best job at matching skills to the installed skills compendiums.  However, cascaded skills are not handled very robustly at this time.  Another limitation of the skill matching is that the names must be an exact match.  For example, a case where the skill is listed on the webpage as &quot;Admin&quot; would not match a compendium skill listed as &quot;Administration&quot;.  The macros try to correct some of these issues based on known naming differences.  But again are not robust to handle all possible name variants.  These importers are only meant for _one_ character at a time.  Moreover, each has specific requirements for the text scope copied (described for each below).\n* **2e Parser for Traveller Tools** - This macro imports a character from [https://travellertools.azurewebsites.net/](https://travellertools.azurewebsites.net/).  It defaults to the included 2e skills compendium. If it doesn&#39;t match a skill to an existing compendium entry it creates a new one for the actor.  To use it: a) run the macro,\nb) copy the portion of the page with the white background (please don&#39;t include the menu items at top in black, c) paste into the dialog window (including the bottom disclaimer), d) click the &#39;generate character&#39; button.\n* **Parser for CE 1001 Characters]** - This macro imports from the site [http://members.ozemail.com.au/~jonoreita/SupplementOne/Cepheus_Engine_1001_characters.html](http://members.ozemail.com.au/~jonoreita/SupplementOne/Cepheus_Engine_1001_characters.html). It only imports one character at a time and _you need to specify that skills are separated by a comma_. Do not change the &quot;dash&quot; separator between the skill and level. After downloading the character from the website, copy and paste the entire text into the macro window. You can process using either the Cepheus Engine or Cepheus Light compendiums.  The selection will change the list of included skills and items for the actor.  The translation of skills from CE to CL may not cover all cases. \n* **CL Character Importer** - This macro imports from the site [https://cepheuslightgen.herokuapp.com/](https://cepheuslightgen.herokuapp.com/).  To use the macro, generate a character on the website and run the macro. Copy - paste all the text between the horizontal lines into the macro text window. Use the generate button to make the character. This particular macro defaults to the CL compendium for skills and items.  Note that the website is still under development and may break the importer at some point.\n\n### Trade Goods Generator\n**Trade Macro** This macro generates a trade table of quantities and buy/sell prices for trade goods on a planet based on the the planets&#39;s UWP.   It uses two inputs:\n\n* UPP: universal planet profile for the location of the transaction (e.g. C898666-5)\n* Trader offset: the DM due to the player characters skill in trading (e.g. broker, EDU, or SOC modifier). If none, enter zero.\n\nYou need to install all the rollable tables (from the system compendium of &quot;twodsix macro rolltables&quot;) that define the goods available and the pricing rolls.  There are eight, total rollable tables (four for each rules set CE or CL).  The tables need to be imported (see section above &quot;Import a Rollable Table&quot;).  Note that the tables for the goods listing have a very specific format that follows the tables layout in the rules.  Each item is tab delimited.\n\nRolling for available goods can either be random (the default) or per the planet trade codes.  This behavior can be changed at line 5, by setting the RANDOM constant from “true” to “false”.  The DEBUG constant is for tracing errors by outputting intermediate calc to the console.  Leave this as false unless you want to make changes / get into the details of the calculations.\n\nSome things that this macro doesn’t handle -\n* Illegal goods are still part of the random roll of goods offered\n* The sell and buy prices aren’t tied to one another, so there can be some odd pricing effects leading to arbitrage windfalls for the players.  This is how the rules work (as best I understand).\n* The macro only uses planet trade codes for the Cepheus Light rules.  The Cepheus Engine have some minor differences for the trade code  &quot;Ba&quot; that could be added to the macro to make it more complete.\n\n### UWP Translator\nThe **UWP Translator** macro takes a UWP code and generates a description based on that code.  This macro uses Rollable Tables found in the subfolder [UWP Tables json](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/tree/master/user_macros/UWP%20Translator/UWP%20Tables%20json) - so install those per the instructions above. There are eleven tables in total.  To run the macro, enter the 8 character UWP code (e.g. C898666-5) into the text field and press the OK button.  A popup window opens with the translation.\n\nLimitations:\n* The macro is currently fixed to using the Cepheus Light UWP descriptions.  To change to Cepheus Engine, edit the lines starting at row 47 from \n&gt; let UWPtables = [\n&gt;     &quot;Starport Type&quot;, &quot;World Size - CL&quot;, &quot;Atmosphere&quot;, &quot;Hydrographics&quot;,\n&gt;     &quot;Population&quot;, &quot;Government&quot;, &quot;Law Level - CL&quot;, &quot;Tech Level - CL&quot;\n&gt;   ];\n\nto\n&gt; let UWPtables = [\n&gt;     &quot;Starport Type&quot;, &quot;World Size - CE&quot;, &quot;Atmosphere&quot;, &quot;Hydrographics&quot;,\n&gt;     &quot;Population&quot;, &quot;Government&quot;, &quot;Law Level - CE&quot;, &quot;Tech Level - CE&quot;\n&gt;   ];\n\n### Random Tables\nThese rollable tables in the Foundry VTT format implement two sets of encounter tables from the Cepheus Engine rules.  They need to be imported into your Foundry VTT world per the instructions above. These tables are not part of the compendiums nor macros but rather full roll tables that work as any other roll table in Foundry. \n\n* The [Random Encounters Table](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/blob/master/user_macros/Random%20Tables/fvtt-RollTable-Random_Encounters.json) implements the roll table appearing in [Chapter 14 (Social Encounters)](https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/social-encounters.html) of the CE SRD rules.  \n* The subfolder [Starship Encounters](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/tree/master/user_macros/Random%20Tables/Starship%20Encounters) implements the cascading roll tables for Starship Encounters from the CE SRD rules in [Chapter 15 (Starship Encounters)](https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/starship-encounters.html#space-encounter-descriptions). All the tables in the sub folder must be installed for the tables to work correctly. The main table is [fvtt-RollTable-Starship_Encounters.json](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/blob/master/user_macros/Random%20Tables/Starship%20Encounters/fvtt-RollTable-Starship_Encounters.json)- roll from that table.  The rest of the tables cascade from it.\n\n### Import Cepheus SRD Subsector\nThis macro imports a subsector description using the SEC format and creates:\n* A new scene with the planets mapped using icons and displaying key system data\n* A set of journal entires in a folder, linked by notes, that correspond to each planet UWP description.\n\nIt is specifically designed to work with the subsector output from  https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/tools/subsector-generator.html\n\nEach planet icon has specific data shown:\n* 12 o&#39;clock: either the UWP for the planet or the trade codes (option selected by user on input window)\n* 3 o&#39;clock: Bases icons.  These include gas giant (Jupiter), Naval (stars), scout (ship), and pirate (skull).\n* 6 o&#39;clock: Planet/System name\n* 9 o&#39;clock: Planet system allegiance code.  Color indicates zone (red or amber if applicable).\n* Center Icon (and notes link): Planets are round circles with Starport Code in the middle.  Asteroids use an asteroid icon instead but also show the starport code.  The colors of planets correspond to certain trade codes: blue = water world, green = garden world, orange = fluid world, dark grey = barren world, gold/brown = desert, and light blue = ice capped.  The size of the circle is proportional to the planet size code.\n\nTo use the macro: \n1. Install the UWP tables, (folder in the system compendium &quot;twodsix macro rolltables&quot;).\n1. Run the macro and paste the planet data into the text box.  It should be of the SEC format. Paste ONLY the text where the planet(s) is/are defined (not the format information), e.g. &quot;Diavlo        0101 D7B1000-7   Ba, Fl           A  010 Na&quot;. The input can handle multiple lines. _Note that if system names are multiple words, these won&#39;t display correctly. Use an underscore instead of spaces, e.g. &quot;Long Name becomes &quot;Long_Name&quot;._\n1. Select the UWP or Trade Codes button (this chooses what information is shown at the 12 o&#39;clock position)\n1. Wait - eventually the new planets should show up in a new scene &quot;Temp Scene&quot;, which you should rename.  The planet icons are note links to journal descriptions, which are placed in a new folder &quot;Export Folder&quot;.\n\nIf you want to edit the notes/icons, you will need to have the &quot;Pin Cushion&quot; module installed and enabled. _Please make certain that notes display toggle is &quot;true&quot;._\n\nA version (Cepheus Deluxe Galaxy Importer) is also available to import Cepheus Deluxe Galaxy output.  To use, install the same tables per above. Then, copy and paste the table text on the right-hand side of a subsector for CDG - _omitting_ the header row. \n\n_Please be aware that the macro assumes that the input matches the expected format and that there is no error messaging or correction._\n\n### Apply Wound Status icons for Cepheus Deluxe\n\n(_**This feature is now implemented in the system - files kept for backwards compatibility**_)\n\n### CD Animal Reaction \nThis macro implements an animal reaction roll per Cepheus Deluxe rules.\n\n### Roll Table with DM\nThis [macro](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/blob/master/user_macros/Roll%20from%20Table%20with%20DM) - provides an example macro to make RollTable roll with a user input dice modifier.  To adapt, change the table name on line 23.\n\n_to be continued_",
        "markdown": "# User Macro Description and Discussion\nThe user macros now are included as part of the installed compendiums for the system.  The files in these wiki folders will no longer be maintained.  The descriptions are still accurate and useful.\n\n## How to import\n### Import a Macro\n1. Open the macro (a file with the extension .js) in GitHub and select the \"raw\" option in the upper right of the code window\n1. Copy all the text (control-a or cmd-a then control-c or cmd-c, depending on your operating system)\n1. Click on a blank item in the macro toolbar in FoundryVTT\n1. A \"New Macro\" window should open - paste the copied text in the \"Command\" window (cmd-v or control-v)\n1. Select \"Script\" as the \"Type\"\n1. Type in a helpful name where it says \"New Macro\"\n1. (optional) Add an icon by clicking on the dice graphic in the upper left corner\n1. Select \"Save Macro\" button\n\n### Import a Rollable Table\n1. Open the rollable table file (it will have a format something like \"fvtt-RollTable-TableName.json\"\n1. Select the \"raw\" option in the upper right of the code window\n1. Download the file (file save as) from your browser's menu - this depends on your browser.  Remember the download name and location\n1. After the file is downloaded, go to the FoundryVTT screen, select the Rollable Table Icon and click the \"Create Table Button\"\n1. Under name type \"temp\" and select the folder you want.\n1. Close the new popup window\n1. Right click the \"temp\" table icon on the tables list\n1. Select \"Import Data\"\n1. Click the browse button and selected the .json file you just downloaded\n1. Click the \"Import\" button\nThe table will automatically be renamed.  _Note: most of the macros that use a rollable table for data input require an exact table name.  You shouldn't rename the table unless you know how to make the corresponding change in the macro script._\n\n## Specific Macro Descriptions\nThis section provides a brief description of what the macros do and how to use them.\n\n### Healing Macros\n* **Heal for GM or Player** - This macro lets a character make a medicine check / skill roll to heal a player (first aid).  The player must have a medkit /medical kit.  A successful roll removes player damage per the effect of the roll.  The characteristic order of healing is, 'endurance', 'strength', 'dexterity'.  The \"multiplier\" constant in the macro is used to adjust the healing amount different rules sets (some rules multiply the effect to calculate the healed damage).  The default multiplier is 1.0 (at line 1).  This value can be changed to suit your rules set.  To run the macro as a GM, you must first target a token (the player being healed) on the current scene. Do this by right clicking the token and select the target button (the bullseye). Next, select the healer by left clicking on that player's token. Run the macro.  To run as the healing player, you just need to target the actor to be healed. _The macro will not work as a player unless you have \"owner\" permissions on the target._\n* **First Aid** - When the player wants to roll their own Medicine check but does not have permissions to change another character's health, this macro takes the _last_ medicine check in the chat log and applies the healing effect.  It is run by the GM and the healed character must be targeted (as the similar macro above).\n\n### NPC Parsers\nThese series of macros take the output of various, online character generators and convert that information into a format that is compatible with a twodsix actor.  While the title says NPC, the generated actor could also be used for a player.  The macros do their best job at matching skills to the installed skills compendiums.  However, cascaded skills are not handled very robustly at this time.  Another limitation of the skill matching is that the names must be an exact match.  For example, a case where the skill is listed on the webpage as \"Admin\" would not match a compendium skill listed as \"Administration\".  The macros try to correct some of these issues based on known naming differences.  But again are not robust to handle all possible name variants.  These importers are only meant for _one_ character at a time.  Moreover, each has specific requirements for the text scope copied (described for each below).\n* **2e Parser for Traveller Tools** - This macro imports a character from [https://travellertools.azurewebsites.net/](https://travellertools.azurewebsites.net/).  It defaults to the included 2e skills compendium. If it doesn't match a skill to an existing compendium entry it creates a new one for the actor.  To use it: a) run the macro,\nb) copy the portion of the page with the white background (please don't include the menu items at top in black, c) paste into the dialog window (including the bottom disclaimer), d) click the 'generate character' button.\n* **Parser for CE 1001 Characters]** - This macro imports from the site [http://members.ozemail.com.au/~jonoreita/SupplementOne/Cepheus_Engine_1001_characters.html](http://members.ozemail.com.au/~jonoreita/SupplementOne/Cepheus_Engine_1001_characters.html). It only imports one character at a time and _you need to specify that skills are separated by a comma_. Do not change the \"dash\" separator between the skill and level. After downloading the character from the website, copy and paste the entire text into the macro window. You can process using either the Cepheus Engine or Cepheus Light compendiums.  The selection will change the list of included skills and items for the actor.  The translation of skills from CE to CL may not cover all cases. \n* **CL Character Importer** - This macro imports from the site [https://cepheuslightgen.herokuapp.com/](https://cepheuslightgen.herokuapp.com/).  To use the macro, generate a character on the website and run the macro. Copy - paste all the text between the horizontal lines into the macro text window. Use the generate button to make the character. This particular macro defaults to the CL compendium for skills and items.  Note that the website is still under development and may break the importer at some point.\n\n### Trade Goods Generator\n**Trade Macro** This macro generates a trade table of quantities and buy/sell prices for trade goods on a planet based on the the planets's UWP.   It uses two inputs:\n\n* UPP: universal planet profile for the location of the transaction (e.g. C898666-5)\n* Trader offset: the DM due to the player characters skill in trading (e.g. broker, EDU, or SOC modifier). If none, enter zero.\n\nYou need to install all the rollable tables (from the system compendium of \"twodsix macro rolltables\") that define the goods available and the pricing rolls.  There are eight, total rollable tables (four for each rules set CE or CL).  The tables need to be imported (see section above \"Import a Rollable Table\").  Note that the tables for the goods listing have a very specific format that follows the tables layout in the rules.  Each item is tab delimited.\n\nRolling for available goods can either be random (the default) or per the planet trade codes.  This behavior can be changed at line 5, by setting the RANDOM constant from “true” to “false”.  The DEBUG constant is for tracing errors by outputting intermediate calc to the console.  Leave this as false unless you want to make changes / get into the details of the calculations.\n\nSome things that this macro doesn’t handle -\n* Illegal goods are still part of the random roll of goods offered\n* The sell and buy prices aren’t tied to one another, so there can be some odd pricing effects leading to arbitrage windfalls for the players.  This is how the rules work (as best I understand).\n* The macro only uses planet trade codes for the Cepheus Light rules.  The Cepheus Engine have some minor differences for the trade code  \"Ba\" that could be added to the macro to make it more complete.\n\n### UWP Translator\nThe **UWP Translator** macro takes a UWP code and generates a description based on that code.  This macro uses Rollable Tables found in the subfolder [UWP Tables json](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/tree/master/user_macros/UWP%20Translator/UWP%20Tables%20json) - so install those per the instructions above. There are eleven tables in total.  To run the macro, enter the 8 character UWP code (e.g. C898666-5) into the text field and press the OK button.  A popup window opens with the translation.\n\nLimitations:\n* The macro is currently fixed to using the Cepheus Light UWP descriptions.  To change to Cepheus Engine, edit the lines starting at row 47 from \n> let UWPtables = [\n>     \"Starport Type\", \"World Size - CL\", \"Atmosphere\", \"Hydrographics\",\n>     \"Population\", \"Government\", \"Law Level - CL\", \"Tech Level - CL\"\n>   ];\n\nto\n> let UWPtables = [\n>     \"Starport Type\", \"World Size - CE\", \"Atmosphere\", \"Hydrographics\",\n>     \"Population\", \"Government\", \"Law Level - CE\", \"Tech Level - CE\"\n>   ];\n\n### Random Tables\nThese rollable tables in the Foundry VTT format implement two sets of encounter tables from the Cepheus Engine rules.

The rest of the tables cascade from it.\n\n### Import Cepheus SRD Subsector\nThis macro imports a subsector description using the SEC format and creates:\n* A new scene with the planets mapped using icons and displaying key system data\n* A set of journal entires in a folder, linked by notes, that correspond to each planet UWP description.\n\nIt is specifically designed to work with the subsector output from  https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/tools/subsector-generator.html\n\nEach planet icon has specific data shown:\n* 12 o'clock: either the UWP for the planet or the trade codes (option selected by user on input window)\n* 3 o'clock: Bases icons.

        "content": "# Overview\nTwodsix now includes the ability to add active effects either directly to Travellers or attached to items/traits (that transfer to an actor when the item is attached).  Such active effect convey bonuses and penalties to an actors attributes.  Most of the attributes can be changed with an active effect - including skills.  For more on how active effects work in Foundry, see this page https://foundryvtt.com/article/active-effects/.  \n\nThere is a new tab on the actor&#39;s sheet that shows which effects (both active and inactive) are attached to an actor.  Also, at the bottom of most items there are buttons to create, edit and/or delete active effects on items. Note that if you edit an active effect on an item already attached to an actor, it will also modify the effect on the actor, too. Note that for items that can be equipped/carried/stored, the effect is _only_ active when the item is equipped.\n\nAll editing of effects uses the standard FVTT dialog for Active Effects.\n\nEffects apply to EVERY roll that actor makes. So don&#39;t use active effects where the bonus is situational.  For example, if a melee weapon confers a +1 attack bonus, put that bonus in the weapon&#39;s skill modifier field and not as an effect.\n\nAttributes changed by an active effect will show the revised value in orange font. Hovering on the changed attribute shows a tooltip for the changes applied.  Note that base value (the attribute value before the AE&#39;s change) aren&#39;t known for token/unlinked actors.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;934&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 9 14 14 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214332486-1ef8e00e-ef0f-43ce-89af-715de7185454.png&quot;&gt;\n\nA helpful option is to display condition icons on the actor image.  This setting is under display settings and will show icons for all effects active on the actor.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;645&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 9 21 59 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214334707-7bba728a-0659-4734-a7b8-089d02685e65.png&quot;&gt;\n\n# Using Item active effects\nYou have to enable in debug settings.  \n\n&lt;img width=&quot;646&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 9 05 47 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214330304-8447d099-4f29-4d65-b55a-e7adfb6f35b3.png&quot;&gt;\n\n**_Note that if you turn off this setting, any effects on actors due to items will be deleted.  This deletion cannot be reversed by re-enabling the option._**\n\n# Data Paths\nMost data (the &quot;Attribute Key&quot;) that you will want to change begin with &quot;system.&quot; The Foundry link above has good instruction on how to find data paths - so start there.  Here is a recent capture of the Traveller data object.  It does not include the &quot;system.&quot; prefix, which is required.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;773&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 12 18 18 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214375524-f888ba67-2d04-4b23-9e40-cb908cb8d7bd.png&quot;&gt;\n\nAnother quick way to find attribute keys is to look at the Token Resources Tab, and then open the attribute list (again you&#39;ll need to prefix with &quot;system.&quot; for the AE change).  To change the strength value for an actor, the attribute key would be &quot;system.characteristics.strength.value&quot;.  To change a skill, use the &quot;Simplified Skill Name&quot; that appears on the skill sheet.  For example, &quot;Gun Combat&quot; would have a key of &quot;system.skills.GunCombat&quot;.  Note that &quot;.value&quot; is not needed in this case as you are modifying a proxy for the skill, not the skill directly. Below is an image of some possible effect changes.\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;614&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 8 59 32 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214328854-105febe6-b722-46e1-93e6-0991db63b118.png&quot;&gt;\n\nNote that you can stack multiple effects on an actor and attribute.  However as the order of calculation is set by FVTT, you may get unexpected results if you mix override and add effects.\n\n# CUSTOM Change Mode\nThe CUSTOM mode for active effects is now supported.  By default, the CUSTOM mode _adds_ a value based on a valid, deterministic (no dice terms) roll formula.  ~Also, no derived values (e.g. @system.characteristics.strength.mod) may be used in the calculations.~  For example, `(@system.characteristics.strength.value - 8)/2` as an effect value will subtract 8 from the actor&#39;s base strength value then divide by two.  _The result of this math is subsequently added to the specified key for the ActiveEffect.  Note that it may be possible to create circular references.  Please be cautious when using this mode._\n\nAs of version 4.24 of Twodsix, the way CUSTOM mode modifies the key value can be specified (similar to a regular active effect).  A `+` prefix to the formula (or no operator) adds the roll formula.  An `=` prefix OVERRIDES the key value with the formula.  A `*` or `/` prefix multiplies or divides respectively.\n\nAs of version 6.0.10 of Twodsix, CUSTOM mode may now include derived data in the formula.  However, this means all CUSTOM calculations occur _after_ any other AE calculations.  So CUSTOM calculations will always have a higher priority in calculations.

This can lead to some odd results in calculating the final value if multiple AE&#39;s affect `system.encumbrance.max`.  To avoid such issues, version 6.9+ now includes and `system.encumbrance.offset` value which is directly added to the `system.encumbrance.max` calculation.  This attribute is only accessible through active effects or macros.  For example, an AE may be affecting maximum encumbrance through an item (e.g. power armor) and also there is an actor effect that changes STR.mod (due to gravity). In such a situation, the offset value is helpful.",
        "markdown": "# Overview\nTwodsix now includes the ability to add active effects either directly to Travellers or attached to items/traits (that transfer to an actor when the item is attached).  Such active effect convey bonuses and penalties to an actors attributes.  Most of the attributes can be changed with an active effect - including skills.  For more on how active effects work in Foundry, see this page https://foundryvtt.com/article/active-effects/.  \n\nThere is a new tab on the actor's sheet that shows which effects (both active and inactive) are attached to an actor.  Also, at the bottom of most items there are buttons to create, edit and/or delete active effects on items. Note that if you edit an active effect on an item already attached to an actor, it will also modify the effect on the actor, too. Note that for items that can be equipped/carried/stored, the effect is _only_ active when the item is equipped.\n\nAll editing of effects uses the standard FVTT dialog for Active Effects.\n\nEffects apply to EVERY roll that actor makes. So don't use active effects where the bonus is situational.  For example, if a melee weapon confers a +1 attack bonus, put that bonus in the weapon's skill modifier field and not as an effect.\n\nAttributes changed by an active effect will show the revised value in orange font. Hovering on the changed attribute shows a tooltip for the changes applied.  Note that base value (the attribute value before the AE's change) aren't known for token/unlinked actors.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n<img width=\"934\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 9 14 14 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214332486-1ef8e00e-ef0f-43ce-89af-715de7185454.png\">\n\nA helpful option is to display condition icons on the actor image.  This setting is under display settings and will show icons for all effects active on the actor.\n\n<img width=\"645\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 9 21 59 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214334707-7bba728a-0659-4734-a7b8-089d02685e65.png\">\n\n# Using Item active effects\nYou have to enable in debug settings.  \n\n<img width=\"646\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 9 05 47 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214330304-8447d099-4f29-4d65-b55a-e7adfb6f35b3.png\">\n\n**_Note that if you turn off this setting, any effects on actors due to items will be deleted.  This deletion cannot be reversed by re-enabling the option._**\n\n# Data Paths\nMost data (the \"Attribute Key\") that you will want to change begin with \"system.\" The Foundry link above has good instruction on how to find data paths - so start there.  Here is a recent capture of the Traveller data object.  It does not include the \"system.\" prefix, which is required.\n\n<img width=\"773\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 12 18 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214375524-f888ba67-2d04-4b23-9e40-cb908cb8d7bd.png\">\n\nAnother quick way to find attribute keys is to look at the Token Resources Tab, and then open the attribute list (again you'll need to prefix with \"system.\" for the AE change).  To change the strength value for an actor, the attribute key would be \"system.characteristics.strength.value\".  To change a skill, use the \"Simplified Skill Name\" that appears on the skill sheet.  For example, \"Gun Combat\" would have a key of \"system.skills.GunCombat\".  Note that \".value\" is not needed in this case as you are modifying a proxy for the skill, not the skill directly. Below is an image of some possible effect changes.\n\n<img width=\"614\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 8 59 32 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580196/214328854-105febe6-b722-46e1-93e6-0991db63b118.png\">\n\nNote that you can stack multiple effects on an actor and attribute.  However as the order of calculation is set by FVTT, you may get unexpected results if you mix override and add effects.\n\n# CUSTOM Change Mode\nThe CUSTOM mode for active effects is now supported.  By default, the CUSTOM mode _adds_ a value based on a valid, deterministic (no dice terms) roll formula.  ~Also, no derived values (e.g. @system.characteristics.strength.mod) may be used in the calculations.~  For example, `(@system.characteristics.strength.value - 8)/2` as an effect value will subtract 8 from the actor's base strength value then divide by two.  _The result of this math is subsequently added to the specified key for the ActiveEffect.  Note that it may be possible to create circular references.  Please be cautious when using this mode._\n\nAs of version 4.24 of Twodsix, the way CUSTOM mode modifies the key value can be specified (similar to a regular active effect).  A `+` prefix to the formula (or no operator) adds the roll formula.  An `=` prefix OVERRIDES the key value with the formula.  A `*` or `/` prefix multiplies or divides respectively.\n\nAs of version 6.0.10 of Twodsix, CUSTOM mode may now include derived data in the formula.  However, this means all CUSTOM calculations occur _after_ any other AE calculations.  So CUSTOM calculations will always have a higher priority in calculations.  If you use multiple AE's for the same attribute and priority of the calculations matter, use CUSTOM mode for all the calculations for that attribute.\n\nAs an example of how this might be useful -\nSupposed you have powered armor that adds +4 to strength and dexterity values but only for the purposes of rolls and encumbrance (not hit points).  You can modify the effects for the powered armor by changing the mod values for strength and dexterity and adding to the max encumbrance.

This feature only works for an active combat scene where there are tokens on a map.  If using theater of the mind, modifiers will need to be added manually.  To use this feature, at least one token must be targeted before rolling the attack.  If no token is selected, no range modifiers are calculated and the roll happens as it normally does. There is a new rules setting (under Advanced Rules Settings -&gt; General) that configures the calculation method for the modifier base on different rules (described later).\n\n# Limitations\nTwodsix makes a number of simplifications to make the calculations feasible across the various rulesets.  The most important of these simplifications to understand is that the calculations in Twodsix always apply a range modifier (e.g. -2) to the roll rather than changing the difficulty.  For example, the Cepheus Deluxe rules change the roll difficulty from average to difficult if the range is between optimal and maximum.  Twodsix would impose a -2 penalty to the roll, instead.  This approach is functionally equivalent to changing the difficulty and has the added advantage of making all the range modifier calculations similar across the rulesets.\n\nOther limitations is that for the calculations to be applied, \n* If more than one token is targeted, the range modifier is calculated for each roll.  _However, the range modifier does not appear in the roll dialog when multiple targets are selected (since it may be different for each target)_.\n* The actor making the attack roll can have _one_ token on the active scene. If an actor controls multiple tokens, the system doesn&#39;t know which token to use for range calculations. For such cases, no range modifier is calculated.\n* A GM must select _one_ active token for the roll for the modifier to be computed.\n* The range to the target is calculated based on the grid distance (e.g. the number of squares times the square size) and not the Euclidean distance.  This measurement matches how the FVTT ruler works. \n\n# Calculation Methods\n## Types\nThere are four different range modifier calculation methods included with Twodsix.  These methods covers the various rulesets included and the appropriate one is automatically set when an included ruleset is chosen (although it can be overridden).\n1. None - This method ignores the range modifier calculation.\n2. Cepheus Engine Bands - This is the Cepheus Engine approach for calculating range modifiers (https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/personal-combat.html#range). Briefly, each weapon is classified with a weapon type under the &quot;Range Band&quot; field.  The distance to target is also classified in a band.\n\n  &lt;img width=&quot;439&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 11 45 45 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/d96e7d57-9bbe-4923-a370-8411ca549bb4&quot;&gt;\n\n  The Range Band field on the weapon is now a select option rather than a freeform text field (_note any existing weapons will need to have this field updated to work_).  The options are weapon types (per the CE SRD rules): Close Quarters, Extended Reach, Thrown, Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun, Assault Weapon, and Rocket. An additional field of &#39;None&#39; has been added to the list; this selection does not apply any range modifier.\n\n3. Classic Traveller Bands - This method follows the calculations for Classic Traveller ruleset based on _The Traveller Book_. Each weapon type (Attacker&#39;s Weapon) has a modifier based on whether the range is Close, Short, Medium, Long or Very Long - per the &quot;Weapons and Range Matrix&quot; page 46 and &quot;Ranges&quot; table on page 47.\n4. Single Value - This method uses a single numeric input from the _Range_ field on the weapon, e.g. 200. The MgT2 rules, for example, follow this calculation method.  If the target range is less than or equal to one quarter of the weapon range, a +1 modifier is added; less than or equal to the range value but greater than one-quarter range results in a zero modifier; less than or equal to twice the range but greater than the range results in a -2 modifier; and less than or equal to four times the range and greater than twice the range results in a -4 roll modifier.\n5. Double Value - This method is common across the Stellagamma Publishing rulesets (e.g. Cepheus Deluxe or Cepheus Faster than Light).  The weapon range setting has two values specified, e.g., 100/200.  The first is the effective value, and a range less than or equal to it results in no roll modifier.  The second value is the maximum range.  A range less than or equal to the maximum but more than the effective value results in a -2 roll modifier (functionally equivalent to increasing the difficulty by one step).  To use this method, the weapons range setting (on the item) _must_ use the &#39;/&#39; character to separate the two ranges.\n\nFor all that above methods, if the attack is infeasible, e.g. beyond maximum range, a -99 roll modifier is added to make the roll fail (except for where a natural 12 is always set to succeed with a setting).  Be advised that ammunition will still be reduced, if applicable.\n\n## Melee Range\nSetting the range value _for methods 4 &amp; 5_ on a melee weapon can be tricky (method 2 &amp; 3 automatically adjust for this range).  Twodsix uses the following conventions for short ranges:\n* A zero value for range means zero range or the same square\n* An empty value (nothing entered) means to skip the range modifier calculation (a zero modifier)\n* If using a standard Traveller grid, 1.5m is the dimension of one square.  So setting the range to 1.5 would be typical for a melee weapon that could strike an adjacent square.  For method 4, specifying only one value is allowed and no &#39;/&#39; is needed.\n* If the word &#39;Melee&#39; is entered into the range, the attack is always allowed up the melee range setting. Otherwise, it is infeasible.\n* When a weapon has a melee range modifier value, that modifier is applied instead of any other range modifiers.   These settings cover cases when using a ranged weapon within melee combat distance.  For example, using a pistol within melee range might suffer a -2 penalty. The melee range modifier can be an integer (e.g. -2) or the string name of the terms used for rolling with advantage or disadvantage per the roll settings (per example &#39;boon&#39; or &#39;bane&#39;):\n\n&lt;img width=&quot;653&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-12-31 at 10 02 58 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/assets/72580196/d044b012-52b3-4a6a-b97f-2e3e7a50ec9b&quot;&gt;\n",

This type of modifier is used in Classic Traveller (and possibly other rulesets).  A new string field has been added to the weapons sheet.  An example modifier looks like `DEX 6/-2 10/+1`.   It translates as - if the actor has a dexterity of 6 or less, a -2 DM is applied to the weapon roll.  If the actor has a dexterity of 10 or more, a +1 DM is applied.  From 7 and 9, no DM is applied.  Note that the abbreviated characteristic name must match the actor&#39;s sheet.  So if you have custom names, you need to use those custom names.\n\nIt is possible to use actor attributes in the formula.  So for a bulky weapon in MgT2, the formula becomes\n`STR 8/@characteristics.strength.mod - 1 9/0`\n\nPlease note that for Classic traveller, the required value (the first number) is less than and not less than or equal to.  So, to enter the CT values, subtract one from the first number as shown in the source material.  For example, if the book shows required as &quot;8/-1&quot;, enter that value as &quot;7/-1&quot; in Twodsix.  The Advantageous input should match the source material. ",
