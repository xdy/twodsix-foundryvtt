# Windows git helper batch files

Some example utility windows batch files. Copy these to somewhere appropriate, don't use them from this folder as I will sometimes update them.
They assume that the folder D:\GitHub exists. If not, you need to edit the batch files.
They X-*_Branch.bat files contain a sample branch name (UltraKevs_Bundle_of_Sticks2). Don't use that one, you should probably use a new branch for each pull request you create/issue you fix.
If you already know your way around git/use an awesome gui, do things your own way. :)
