The character chooses a game by its odds of winning (high, average, low, small or remote) and places a bet. The Referee determines if the game is rigged. The character then rolls their Gambling score. On a success, the character receives the payoff amount based on the amount of their initial bet. House always wins on a natural 2.   Competitive Games: If playing against a group of other players, each member of the game will make their Gambling skill check with the highest roll taking the pot. A character may attempt to cheat during a game at any time by stating his or her intent to cheat and making an extra Gambling check. If any other player in the game makes a successful opposing Gambling check against the character's attempt at cheating they are caught redhanded.
